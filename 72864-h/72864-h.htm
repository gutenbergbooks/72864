<h3>THE MINISTER’S WOOING.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Sympathy.</div>

<p>When we feel a thing ourselves, we can
see very quick the same in others.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Self-deception.</div>

<p>When a finely constituted nature wishes
to go into baseness, it has first to bribe
itself. Evil is never embraced, undisguised, as
evil, but under some fiction which the mind
accepts, and with which it has the singular power
of blinding itself in the face of daylight. The
power of imposing on one’s self is an essential
preliminary to imposing on others. The man
first argues himself down, and then he is ready
to put the whole weight of his nature to deceiving
others.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Soul-communion.</div>

<p>Perhaps it is so, that souls once intimately
related have ever after this a
strange power of affecting each other,—a power
that neither absence nor death can annul. How
else can we interpret those mysterious hours in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
which the power of departed love seems to overshadow
us, making our souls vital with such longings,
with such wild throbbings, with such unutterable
sighings, that a little more might burst
the mortal bond? Is it not deep calling unto
deep? the free soul singing outside the cage to
her mate beating against the bars within?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Soul-absorption.</div>

<p>The greatest moral effects are like those
of music,—not wrought out by sharp-sided
intellectual propositions, but melted in by
a divine fusion, by words that have mysterious,
indefinite fulness of meaning, made living by
sweet voices, which seem to be the out-throbbings
of angelic hearts. So one verse in the
Bible read by a mother in some hour of tender
prayer has a significance deeper and higher than
the most elaborate of sermons, the most acute of
arguments.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Restrictions
of
the body
on the
soul.</div>

<p>Scarcely conscious, she lay in that dim,
clairvoyant state, when the half-sleep of
the outward senses permits a delicious
dewy clearness of the soul, that perfect
ethereal rest and freshness of the faculties, comparable
only to what we imagine of the spiritual
state,—season of celestial enchantment, in which
the heavy weight “of all this unintelligible world”
drops off, and the soul, divinely charmed, nestles
like a wind-tossed bird in the protecting bosom
of the One All-perfect, All-beautiful. What visions
then come to the inner eye have often no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
words corresponding in mortal vocabularies.
The poet, the artist, and the prophet in such
hours become possessed of divine certainties
which all their lives they struggle, with pencil
or song or burning words, to make evident to
their fellows. The world around wonders, but
they are unsatisfied, because they have seen the
glory and know how inadequate the copy.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Courage in
the truth.</div>

<p>Half the misery in the world comes of
want of courage to speak and to hear the
truth plainly and in a spirit of love.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Miss Prissy’s
motto.</div>

<p>“Tho’ I can’t say I’m lone either,
because nobody need say that, so long
as there’s folks to be done for.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Blessedness
<i>vs.</i>
happiness.</div>

<p>We could not afford to have it always
night,—and we must think that the
broad, gay morning-light, when meadowlark
and robin and bobolink are singing in chorus
with a thousand insects and the waving of a
thousand breezes, is on the whole the most in
accordance with the average wants of those
who have a material life to live and material
work to do. But then we reverence that clear-obscure
of midnight, when everything is still and
dewy;—then sing the nightingales, which cannot
be heard by day; then shine the mysterious
stars. So when all earthly voices are hushed in
the soul, all earthly lights darkened, music and
color float in from a higher sphere.... By
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
what name shall we call this beautiful twilight,
this night of the soul, so starry with heavenly
mysteries?   <em>Not</em> happiness, but blessedness.
They who have it walk among men as “sorrowful,
yet alway rejoicing, as poor, yet making
many rich,—as having nothing, and yet possessing
all things.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Laws of
prayer.</div>

<p>Is it not possible that He who made
the world may have established laws for
prayer as invariable as those for the sowing of
seed and raising of grain? Is it not as legitimate
a subject of inquiry, when petitions are not
answered, which of these laws has been neglected?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Influence
of the
invisible.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Woman
feels; man
reasons.</div>

<p>No real artist or philosopher ever
lived who has not at some hours risen
to the height of utter self-abnegation
for the glory of the invisible. There have been
painters who would have been crucified to demonstrate
the action of a muscle,—chemists who
would gladly have melted themselves and all
humanity in their crucible, if so a new discovery
might arise out of its fumes. Even persons of
mere artistic sensibility are at times raised by
music, painting, or poetry, to a momentary trance
of self-oblivion, in which they would offer their
whole being before the shrine of an invisible
loveliness.... But where theorists and
philosophers tread with sublime assurance,
woman often follows with bleeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
footsteps;—women are always turning
from the abstract to the individual, and feeling
where the philosopher only thinks.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Love a sacrament.</div>

<p>True love is a natural sacrament; and
if ever a young man thanks God for
having saved what is noble and manly in his soul,
it is when he thinks of offering it to the woman
he loves.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">God’s
tests.</div>

<p>“Mr. Scudder used to say that it took
great affliction to bring his mind to that
place,” said Mrs. Katy. “He used to say that an
old paper-maker told him once, that paper that
was shaken only one way in the making would
tear across the other, and the best paper had to
be shaken every way; and so he said we couldn’t
tell till we had been turned and shaken and
tried every way, where we should tear.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Unconscious
heart-thrusts.</div>

<p>So we go,—so little knowing what we
touch and what touches us as we talk!
We drop out a common piece of news,—“Mr.
So-and-so is dead,”—“Miss Such-a-one
is married,”—“Such a ship has sailed,”—and
lo, on our right hand or our left, some heart has
sunk under the news silently,—gone down in
the great ocean of Fate, without even a bubble
rising to tell its drowning pang. And this—God
help us!—is what we call living!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Repression.</div>

<p>It was not pride, nor sternness, but a
sort of habitual shamefacedness that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
kept far back in each soul those feelings which
are the most beautiful in their outcome; but
after a while the habit became so fixed a nature
that a caressing or affectionate expression could
not have passed the lips of one to another without
a painful awkwardness. Love was understood,
once for all, to be the basis on which their
life was built. Once for all, they loved each
other, and after that, the less said, the better. It
had cost the woman’s heart of Mrs. Marvin some
pangs, in the earlier part of her wedlock, to
accept of this   <em>once for all</em> in place of those daily
outgushings which every woman desires should be
like God’s loving-kindnesses, “new every morning;”
but hers, too, was a nature strongly inclining
inward, and, after a few tremulous movements,
the needle of her soul settled, and her
life-lot was accepted,—not as what she would
like or could conceive, but as a reasonable and
good one. Life was a picture painted in low,
cool tones, but in perfect keeping; and though
another and brighter style might have pleased
better, she did not quarrel with this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Winged
and walking
spirits.</div>

<p>There are in this world two kinds of
natures,—those that have wings, and
those that have feet,—the winged and
the walking spirits. The walking are the logicians;
the winged are the instinctive and poetic.
Natures that must always walk find many a bog,
many a thicket, many a tangled brake, which
God’s happy little winged birds flit over by one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
noiseless flight. Nay, when a man has toiled till
his feet weigh too heavily with the mud of earth
to enable him to walk another step, these little
birds will often cleave the air in a right line
towards the bosom of God, and show the way
where he could never have found it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Unity in
prayer.</div>

<p>The truly good are of one language
in prayer. Whatever lines or angles of
thought may separate them in other hours,   <em>when
they pray in extremity</em>, all good men pray alike.
The Emperor Charles V. and Martin Luther,
two great generals of opposite faiths, breathed
out their dying struggles in the self-same words.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Sympathy

<p>As well might those on the hither
side of mortality instruct the souls gone
beyond the veil, as souls outside a great
affliction guide those who are struggling in it.
That is a mighty baptism, and only Christ can
go down with us into those waters.</p>

<hr class="tb">
<div class="sidenote">Agony of
uncertainty.</div>

<p>Against an uncertainty, who can brace
the soul? We put all our forces of
faith and prayer against it, and it goes
down just as a buoy sinks in the water, and the
next moment it is up again. The soul fatigues
itself with efforts which come and go in waves;
and when with laborious care it has adjusted all
things in the light of hope, back flows the tide
and sweeps all away. In such struggles life
spends itself fast; an inward wound does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
carry one deathward more surely than this worst
wound of the soul. God has made us so mercifully
that there is no   <em>certainty</em>, however dreadful,
to which life-forces do not in time adjust themselves;
but to uncertainty there is no possible
adjustment.</p>

<p>So we go, dear reader,—so long as
we have a body and a soul. For worlds
must mingle,—the great and the little, the solemn
and the trivial, wreathing in and out, like
the grotesque carvings on a gothic shrine; only,
did we know it rightly, nothing is trivial, since
the human soul, with its awful shadow, makes
all things sacred. Have not ribbons, cast-off
flowers, soiled bits of gauze, trivial, trashy fragments
of millinery, sometimes had an awful
meaning, a deadly power, when they belonged to
one who should wear them no more, and whose
beautiful form, frail and crushed as they, is a
hidden and vanished thing for all time? For so
sacred and individual is a human being, that, of
all the million-peopled earth, no one form ever
restores another. The mould of each mortal
type is broken at the grave; and never, never,
though you look through all the faces on earth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
shall the exact form you mourn ever meet your
eyes again! You are living your daily life among
trifles that one death-stroke may make relics.
One false step, one luckless accident, an obstacle
on the track of a train, the tangling of a cord in
shifting a sail, and the penknife, the pen, the
papers, the trivial articles of dress and clothing,
which to-day you toss idly and jestingly from
hand to hand, may become dread memorials of
that awful tragedy whose deep abyss ever underlies
our common life.</p>

<p>All the little, mean work of our nature

<div class="sidenote">The divine

<p>As to every leaf and every flower
there is an ideal to which the growth of
the plant is constantly urging, so is there an ideal
to every human being,—a perfect form in which
it might appear, were every defect removed, and
every characteristic excellence stimulated to the
highest point. Once in an age, God sends to
some of us a friend who loves in us, not a false
imagining, an unreal character, but, looking
through all the rubbish of our imperfections,
loves in us the divine ideal of our nature,—loves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>

<div class="sidenote">Responsibility.</div>

<p>To feel the immortality of a beloved

thought that can pervade a mind.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Developing

<p>What makes the love of a great mind

that it is often the unsealing of a hitherto

being.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Unsuspected
influence.</div>

<p>It is said that if a grapevine be
planted in the neighborhood of a well,
its roots, running silently underground,
wreathe themselves in a network round the cold,
clear waters, and the vine’s putting on outward
greenness and unwonted clusters and fruit is all
that tells where every root and fibre of its being
has been silently stealing. So, those loves are
most fatal, most absorbing, in which, with unheeded
quietness, every thought and fibre of our
life twines gradually around some human soul,
to us the unsuspected wellspring of our being.
Fearful it is, because so often the vine must be
uprooted, and all its fibres wrenched away; but
till the hour of discovery comes, how is it transfigured
by a new and beautiful life!</p>

<p>Gradually an expression of intense interest

which held them for a time under the shadow of
his own awful sense of God’s almighty justice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Soul-growth.</div>

<p>There is a ladder to heaven whose base
God has placed in human affections,
tender instincts, symbolic feelings, sacraments of
love, through which the soul rises higher and
higher, refining as she goes, till she outgrows the
human, and changes, as she rises, into the image
of the divine. At the very top of this ladder,
at the threshold of Paradise, blazes dazzling and
crystalline that celestial grade where the soul
knows self no more, having learned, through a
long experience of devotion, how blest it is to
lose herself in that eternal Love and Beauty, of
which all earthly fairness and grandeur are but
the dim type, the distant shadow.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Discipline.</div>

<p>It is said that gardeners sometimes,
when they would bring a rose to richer flowering,
deprive it, for a time, of light and moisture.
Silent and dark it stands, dropping one faded
leaf after another, and seeming to go down
patiently to death. But when every leaf is
dropped, and the plant stands stripped to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
uttermost, a new life is even then working in the
buds, from which shall spring a tender foliage,
and a brighter wealth of flowers. So, often
in celestial gardening, every leaf of earthly joy
must drop, before a new and divine bloom visits
the soul.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Idealizing
power of
love.</div>

<p>In a refined and exalted nature, it is
very seldom that the feeling of love,
when once thoroughly aroused, bears
any sort of relation to the reality of the object.
It is commonly an enkindling of the whole power
of the soul’s love for whatever she considers
highest and fairest; it is, in fact, the love of
something divine and unearthly, which, by a
sort of illusion, connects itself with a personality.
Properly speaking, there is but one true,
eternal object of all that the mind conceives, in
this trance of its exaltation. Disenchantment
must come, of course; and in a love which terminates
in happy marriage, there is a tender and
gracious process by which, without shock or violence,
the ideal is gradually sunk in the real,
which, though found faulty and earthly, is still
ever tenderly remembered as it seemed under
the morning light of that enchantment.</p>

deepest faintings.” And so it came to pass that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
as this poor woman closed her eyes and prayed

<p>Esther was one of those intense, silent,

in course of descent, so that the child of a
long line of pious ancestry may sometimes suffer
from too fine a moral fibre, and become a victim
to a species of morbid   <em>spiritual ideality</em>.</p>

<p>Among all the loves that man has to

the victory over every sin and every sorrow, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
live perpetually on the banks of the dark river,
in that bright, calm land of Beulah, where angels
daily walk to and fro, and sounds of celestial
music are heard across the water.</p>

<p class="indent">Such have no longer personal cares, or griefs,
or sorrows. The tears of life have all been shed,
and therefore they have hearts at leisure to
attend to every one else. Even the sweet guileless
childishness that comes on in this period has

<p>Has there ever been a step in human

for all this, is there not a true unity of the faith
in all good hearts? And when they have risen

very reserve and silence are a fortification
behind which all their peculiarities grow and
thrive at their leisure, without encountering those
blows and shocks which materially modify more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
outspoken natures. It is owing to the peculiar
power of quietness that one sometimes sees characters
fashioning themselves in a manner the
least to be expected from the circumstances and
associates which surround them. As a fair white
lily grows up out of the bed of meadow muck,
and without note or comment rejects all in the
soil that is alien from her being, and goes on
fashioning her own silver cup side by side with
weeds that are drawing coarser nutriment from
the soil, so we often see a refined and gentle
nature, by some singular internal force, unfolding
itself by its own laws, and confirming itself in
its own beliefs, as wholly different from all that
surround it as is the lily from the ragweed. There

the shores of the river of this mortal life up
which we sail, ofttimes disappointed and complaining.
We are seeing all things in winter,
and not as they will be when God shall wipe

<p>I remember my school-day speculations
over an old “Chemistry” I used to

a substance called Caloric exists in all bodies.
In some it exists in a latent state; it is there,
but it affects neither the senses nor the thermometer.
Certain causes develop it, when it raises
the mercury and warms the hands. I remember
the awe and wonder with which, even then,
I reflected on the vast amount of blind, deaf,
and dumb comfort which Nature had thus stowed
away. How mysterious it seemed to me that
poor families every winter should be shivering,
freezing, and catching cold, when Nature had
all this latent caloric locked up in her store-closet,—when
it was all around them, in everything
they touched and handled!</p>

You do not freeze, but you shiver; your fingers
do not become numb with cold, but you have all
the while an uneasy craving for more positive
warmth. You look at the empty grate, walk
mechanically towards it, and, suddenly awaking,
shiver to see that there is nothing there. You
long for a shawl or a cloak; you draw yourself
within yourself; you consult the thermometer,
and are vexed to find that there is nothing there
to be complained of,—it is standing most provokingly
at the exact temperature that all the
good books and good doctors pronounce to be the
proper thing,—the golden mean of health; and
yet perversely you shiver, and feel as if the face

<p class="indent">Such a life-long chill, such an habitual shiver,
is the lot of many natures, which are not warm,
when all ordinary rules tell them they ought to
be warm,—whose life is cold and barren and
meagre,—which never see the blaze of an open
fire.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Regret.</div>

<p>The bitterest tears shed over graves are
for words left unsaid and deeds left undone.
“She never knew how I loved her.” “He never
knew what he was to me.” “I always meant to
make more of our friendship.” “I never knew
what he was to me till he was gone.” Such
words are the poisoned arrows which cruel Death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
shoots backward at us from the door of the
sepulchre.</p>

<p class="indent">How much more we might make of our family
life, of our friendships, if every secret thought of
love blossomed into a deed! We are not now
speaking of personal caresses. These may or
may not be the best language of affection. Many
are endowed with a delicacy, a fastidiousness of
physical organization, which shrinks away from
too much of these, repelled and overpowered.
But there are words and looks and little observances,
thoughtfulnesses, watchful little attentions,
which speak of love, which make it manifest, and
there is scarce a family that might not be richer
in heart-wealth for more of them.</p>


<h3 class="p3">HOUSE AND HOME PAPERS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">First
principles
of home-making.</div>

<p>In this art of home-making I have set
down in my mind certain first principles,
like the axioms of Euclid, and the
first is,—</p>

<p class="indent">  <em>No home is possible without love.</em></p>

<p class="indent">All business marriages and marriages of convenience,
all mere culinary marriages and marriages
of mere animal passion, make the creation
of a true home impossible in the outset. Love
is the jewelled foundation of this New Jerusalem
descending from God out of heaven, and
takes as many bright forms as the amethyst,
topaz, and sapphire of that mysterious vision.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
In this range of creative art all things are possible
to him that loveth, but without love nothing
is possible.</p>


<h3 class="p3">THE CHIMNEY CORNER.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Conversation.</div>

<p>  <em>Real</em> conversation presupposes intimate
acquaintance. People must see each
other often enough to wear off the rough bark
and outside rind of commonplaces and conventionalities
in which their real ideas are enwrapped,
and give forth without reserve their
innermost and best feelings.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Saintliness.</div>

<p>What makes saintliness, in my view, as
distinguished from ordinary goodness,
is a certain quality of magnanimity and greatness
of soul that brings life within the circle of the
heroic. To be really great in little things, to be
truly noble and heroic in the insipid details of
every-day life, is a virtue so rare as to be worthy
of canonization.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Teachings
of suffering.</div>

<p>There is a certain amount of suffering
which must follow the rending of the
great cords of life, suffering which is
natural and inevitable: it cannot be argued
down; it cannot be stilled; it can no more be
soothed by any effort of faith and reason than the
pain of a fractured limb, or the agony of fire on
the living flesh. All that we can do is to brace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
ourselves to bear it, calling on God, as the martyrs
did in the fire, and resigning ourselves to let
it burn on. We must be willing to suffer, since
God so wills. There are just so many waves to
go over us, just so many arrows of stinging
thought to be shot into our soul, just so many
faintings and sinkings and revivings only to suffer
again, belonging to and inherent in our portion
of sorrow; and there is a work of healing that
God has placed in the hands of Time alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Time heals all things at last; yet it depends
much on us in our sufferings, whether Time shall
send us forth healed, indeed, but maimed and
crippled and callous, or whether, looking to the
great Physician of sorrows, and coworking with
him, we come forth stronger and fairer even for
our wounds.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Help in
sorrow.</div>

<p>One soul redeemed will do more to lift
the burden of sorrow than all the blandishments
and diversions of art, all the alleviations
of luxury, all the sympathy of friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Affinity of

<p>From that time a friendship commenced
between the two which was a beautiful
illustration of the affinities of opposites. It was
like a friendship between morning and evening,—all
freshness and sunshine on one side, and all
gentleness and peace on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Superiority.</div>

<p>It is one mark of a superior mind to
understand and be influenced by the
superiority of others.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Sympathy.</div>

<p>The same quickness which makes a

and most sympathetic in sorrow.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">God’s
sympathy.</div>

<p>It is well for man that there is one
Being who sees the suffering heart   <em>as
it is</em>, and not as it manifests itself through the
repellences of outward infirmity, and who, perhaps,
feels more for the stern and wayward than
for those whose gentler feelings win for them
human sympathy.</p>

<p>He had traced her, even as a hidden

verdure of heart, which her deeds of kindness
had left wherever she had passed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Capacity
of feeling.</div>

<p>A very unnecessary and uncomfortable
capacity of   <em>feeling</em>, which, like a refined
ear for music, is undesirable, because, in this
world, one meets with discord ninety-nine times
where one meets with harmony once.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Heart-wisdom
<i>vs.</i>
worldly
wisdom.</div>

<p>How very contrary is the obstinate estimate
of the heart to the rational estimate
of worldly wisdom! Are there not
some who can remember when one word, one
look, or even the withholding of a word, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
drawn their heart more to a person than all the
substantial favors in the world? By ordinary
acceptation, substantial kindness respects the
necessaries of animal existence, while those
wants which are peculiar to mind, and will exist
with it forever, by equally correct classification,
are designated as sentimental ones, the supply of
which, though it will excite more gratitude in
fact, ought not to in theory.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Living

<p>From that time I   <em>lived</em> with her—and
there are some persons who can make
the word   <em>live</em> signify much more than it commonly
does—and she wrought on my character
all those miracles which benevolent genius can
work. She quieted my heart, directed my feelings,
unfolded my mind, and educated me, not
harshly or by force, but as the blessed sunshine
educates the flower, into full and perfect life;
and when all that was mortal of her died to this
world, her words and deeds of unutterable love
shed a twilight around her memory that will fade
only in the brightness of heaven.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Ministering
spirits.</div>

<p>What then? May we look among the
band of ministering spirits for our own
departed ones? Whom would God be more
likely to send us? Have we in heaven a friend
who knew us to the heart’s core? a friend to
whom we have unfolded our soul in its most
secret recesses? to whom we have confessed our
weaknesses and deplored our griefs? If we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
to have a ministering spirit, who better adapted?
Have we not memories which correspond to such
a belief? When our soul has been cast down,
has never an invisible voice whispered, “There
is lifting up”? Have not gales and breezes of
sweet and healing thought been wafted over us,
as if an angel had shaken from his wings the
odors of paradise? Many a one, we are confident,
can remember such things,—and whence come
they? Why do the children of the pious mother,
whose grave has grown green and smooth with
years, seem often to walk through perils and
dangers fearful and imminent as the crossing of
Mohammed’s fiery gulf on the edge of a drawn
sword, yet walk unhurt? Ah! could we see that
attendant form, that face where the angel conceals
not the mother, our question would be
answered.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Influence of a mother’s prayer.</div>

<p>Something there is in the voice of real
prayer that thrills a child’s heart, even
before he understands it; the holy
tones are a kind of heavenly music, and far-off
in distant years, the callous and worldly man
often thrills to his heart’s core, when some turn
of life recalls to him his mother’s prayer.</p>


<h3 class="p3">PINK AND WHITE TYRANNY.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Taught by
suffering.</div>

<p>It sometimes seems to take a stab, a
thrust, a wound, to open in some hearts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
the capacity of deep feeling and deep thought.
There are things taught by suffering that can be
taught in no other way. By suffering sometimes
is wrought out in a person the power of loving
and of appreciating love. During the first year,
Lillie had often seemed to herself in a sort of
wild, chaotic state. The coming in of a strange,
new, spiritual life was something so inexplicable
to her that it agitated and distressed her; and
sometimes, when she appeared more petulant and
fretful than usual, it was only the stir and vibration
on her weak nerves of new feelings, which
she wanted the power to express. These emotions
at first were painful to her. She felt weak,
miserable, and good-for-nothing. It seemed to
her that her whole life had been a wretched
cheat, and that she had ill repaid the devotion of
her husband. At first these thoughts only made
her bitter and angry; and she contended against
them. But, as she sank from day to day, and
grew weaker and weaker, she grew more gentle;
and a better spirit seemed to enter into her.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The object
of life.</div>

<p>“The great object of life is not happiness;
and when we have lost our own
personal happiness, we have not lost all that life
is worth living for. No, John, the very best of
life often lies beyond that. When we have
learned to let ourselves go, then we may find
that there is a better, a nobler, and a truer life
for us.” ... “If we contend with, and fly from
our duties, simply because they gall us and burden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
us, we go against everything; but if we take
them up bravely, then everything goes with us.
God and good angels and good men and all good
influences are working with us when we are
working for the right. And in this way, John,
you may come to happiness; or, if you do not
come to personal happiness, you may come to
something higher and better. You know that
you think it nobler to be an honest man than a
rich man; and I am sure that you will think
it better to be a good man than to be a happy
one.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Self-ignorance.</div>

<p>It is astonishing how blindly people
sometimes go on as to the character of
their own conduct, till suddenly, like a torch in a
dark place, the light of another person’s opinion
is thrown in upon them, and they begin to judge
themselves under the quickening influence of
another person’s moral magnetism. Then, indeed,
it often happens that the graves give up
their dead, and that there is a sort of interior
resurrection and judgment.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Sympathy.</div>

<p>When we are feeling with the nerves of

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Unacknowledged
motives.</div>

<p>No, she did not say it. It would be
well for us all if we   <em>did</em> put into words,
plain and explicit, many instinctive resolves
and purposes that arise in our hearts, and
which, for want of being so expressed, influence
us undetected and unchallenged. If we would
say out boldly, “I don’t care for right or wrong,
or good or evil, or anybody’s rights or anybody’s
happiness, or the general good, or God himself,—all
I care for, or feel the least interest in, is
to have a good time myself, and I mean to do it,
come what may,”—we should be only expressing
a feeling which often lies in the dark back-room
of the human heart; and saying it might
alarm us from the drugged sleep of life. It
might rouse us to shake off the slow, creeping
paralysis of selfishness and sin before it is forever
too late.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Power of

<p>Such is the wonderful power of human
sympathy that the discovery even of the
existence of a soul capable of understanding our
inner life often operates as a perfect charm;
every thought and feeling and aspiration carries
with it a new value, from the interwoven consciousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
that attends it, of the worth it would
bear to that other mind; so that, while that person

<p>But he soon discovered, what every

how utterly powerless and inert any mortal man

convictions. With bitter discouragement and
chagrin, he saw that the spiritual man must forever
lift the dead weight of all the indolence and
indifference and animal sensuality that surround
him,—that the curse of Cassandra is upon him,
forever to burn and writhe under awful visions
of truths which no one around him will regard.</p>

<p>When a man has once lost that unconscious

no prayer, no anguish of remorse, can give back
the simplicity of a soul that has never been

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The strongest
passions.</div>

<p>No passions are deeper in their hold,
more pervading and more vital to the
whole human being, than those that
make their first entrance through the higher
nature, and, beginning with a religious and
poetic ideality, gradually work their way through
the whole fabric of the human existence. From
grosser passions, whose roots lie in the senses,
there is always a refuge in man’s loftier nature.
He can cast them aside with contempt, and leave
them as one whose lower story is flooded can
remove to a higher loft, and live serenely with a
purer air and wider prospect. But to love that
is born of ideality, of intellectual sympathy, of
harmonies of the spiritual and immortal nature,
of the very poetry and purity of the soul, if it be
placed where reason and religion forbid its exercise
and expression, what refuge but the grave,—what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Agony in

<p>It is singular how the dumb, imprisoned
soul, locked within the walls of the

the tones of the voice during the access of a great
agony. The effect is entirely involuntary and
often against the most strenuous opposition of
the will; but one sometimes hears another reading

living force, which tells of some inward anguish
or conflict of which the language itself gives no

sordid courses, without ever a spark of religious

<div class="sidenote">Coincidence.</div>

resting in beatified repose; and he fondly thought
all this was firm reality, and believed that he
was now proof against all earthly impressions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
able to hear and to judge with the dispassionate
calmness of a disembodied spirit. He did not
know that this high-strung calmness, this fine

nervous sensibility, and as vividly susceptible to
every mortal impression as is the vitalized chemical

words more wisely descriptive of the true religious
sentiment, than another man whose whole
life is governed by it. In such minds, disregard
of religion is a more fearful treason,—a more
deadly sin.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Superstition.</div>

<p>No one is so thoroughly superstitious as
the godless man. The Christian is composed
by the belief of a wise, all-ruling Father,
whose presence fills the void unknown with light
and order; but to the man who has dethroned
God, the spirit-land is, indeed, in the words of
the Hebrew poet, “a land of darkness and the
shadow of death,” without any order, where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
light is as darkness. Life and death to him are
haunted grounds, filled with goblin forms of
vague and shadowy dread.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The human
soul.</div>

<p>After all, let a man take what pains he
may to hush it down, a human soul is
an awful ghostly, unquiet possession for a bad
man to have. Who knows the metes and bounds
of it? Who knows all its awful perhapses,—those
shudderings and tremblings which it can
no more live down than it can outlive its own
eternity! What a fool is he who locks his door
to keep out spirits, who has in his own bosom
a spirit he dares not meet alone,—whose voice,
smothered far down, and piled over with mountains
of earthliness, is yet like the forewarning
trumpet of doom!</p>


<h3 class="p3">DRED.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Practical
and ideal.</div>

<p>The divine part of man is often shame-faced
and self-distrustful, ill at home in
this world, and standing in awe of nothing so
much as what is called common sense; and yet
common sense very often, by its own keenness,
is able to see that these unavailable currencies of
another’s mind are of more worth, if the world
only knew it, than the ready coin of its own; and
so the practical and the ideal nature are drawn
together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Inexplicable
preferences.</div>

<p>Sensitive people never like the fatigue
of justifying their instincts. Nothing,
in fact, is less capable of being justified
by technical reasons than those fine insights into
character whereupon affection is built. We have
all had experience of preferences which would
not follow the most exactly ascertained catalogue
of virtues, and would be made captive where
there was very little to be said in justification of
the captivity.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Congeniality
of opposites.</div>

<p>“Why, surely,” said Anne, “one wants
one’s friends to be congenial, I should
think.”</p>

<p>“So we do; and there is nothing in the world
so congenial as differences. To be sure, the
differences must be harmonious. In music, now,
for instance, one doesn’t want a repetition of the
same notes, but differing notes that chord. Nay,
even discords are indispensable to complete harmony.
Now, Nina has just that difference from
me which chords with me; and all our little
quarrels—for we have had a good many, and I
dare say shall have more—are only a sort of
chromatic passages,—discords of the seventh,
leading into harmony. My life is inward, theorizing,
self-absorbed. I am hypochondriac,
often morbid. The vivacity and acuteness of her
outer life makes her just what I need. She
wakens, she rouses, and keeps me in play; and
her quick instincts are often more than a match
for my reason.”</p>

<p>“How do you know there is any heaven,

<p class="indent">“Know it?” said Milly, her eyes kindling,
and striking her staff on the ground, “Know it?
I know it by de   <em>hankering arter it</em> I got in
here;” giving her broad chest a blow which
made it resound like a barrel. “De Lord
knowed what he was ’bout when he made us.
When he made babies rootin’ ’round, wid der
poor little mouths open, he made milk, and de
mammies for ’em too. Chile, we’s nothing but
great babies, dat ain’t got our eyes open,—rootin’
’round an’ ’round; but de Father ’ll feed
us yet—He will so.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Night resolutions.</div>

<p>What we have thought and said under
the august presence of witnessing stars,
or beneath the holy shadows of moonlight, seems
with the dry, hot heat of next day’s sun to take
wings, and rise to heaven with the night’s clear
drops. If all the prayers and good resolutions
which are laid down on sleeping pillows could
be found there on awaking, the world would be
better than it is.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Transition
periods.</div>

<p>There are times in life when the soul,
like a half-grown climbing vine, hangs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
hovering tremulously, stretching out its tendrils
for something to ascend by. Such are generally
the great transition periods of life, when we are
passing from the ideas and conditions of one
stage of existence to those of another. Such
times are most favorable for the presentation of
the higher truths of religion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Connection
with the
spirit
world.</div>

<p>This life may truly be called a haunted
house, built as it is on the very confines
of the land of darkness and the shadow
of death. A thousand living fibres connect us
with the unknown and unseen state; and the
strongest hearts, which never stand still for any
mortal terror, have sometimes hushed their very
beating at a breath of a whisper from within the
veil. Perhaps the most resolute unbeliever in
spiritual things has hours of which he would be
ashamed to tell, when he, too, yields to the
powers of those awful affinities which bind us to
that unknown realm.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Suffering
in silence.</div>

<p>It is the last triumph of affection and
magnanimity, when a loving heart can
respect the suffering silence of its beloved, and
allow that lonely liberty in which only some
natures can find comfort.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Joy in endurance.</div>

<p>And, as he sang and prayed, that
strange joy arose within him, which,
like the sweetness of night flowers, is born of
darkness and tribulation. The soul has in it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
somewhat of the divine, in that it can have joy
in endurance beyond the joy of indulgence.</p>

<p class="indent">They mistake who suppose that the highest
happiness lies in wishes accomplished—in prosperity,
wealth, favor, and success. There has
been a joy in dungeons and on racks passing the
joy of harvest. A joy strange and solemn,
mysterious even to its possessor. A white stone
dropped from that signet ring, peace, which a
dying Saviour took from his own bosom, and
bequeathed to those who endure the cross, despising
the shame.</p>


<h3 class="p3">SUNNY MEMORIES OF FOREIGN LANDS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Inward
peace.</div>

<p>How natural it is to say of some place
sheltered, simple, cool, and retired, here
one might find peace, as if peace came from
without, and not from within. In the shadiest
and stillest places may be the most turbulent
hearts, and there are hearts which, through the
busiest scenes, carry with them unchanging peace.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Grace in
affliction.</div>

<p>I have read of Alpine flowers leaning
their cheeks on the snow. I wonder if
any flowers grow near enough to that snow to
touch it. I mean to go and see. So I went;
there, sure enough, my little fringed purple bell,
to which I had give the name of “suspirium,”
was growing, not only close to the snow but in it.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus God’s grace, shining steadily on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
waste places of the human heart, brings up heavenward
sighings and aspirations, which pierce
through the cold snows of affliction, and tell that
there is yet life beneath.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">God as an
artist.</div>

<p>I was glad to walk on alone: for the
scenery was so wonderful that human
sympathy and communion seemed to be out of
the question. The effect of such scenery to our
generally sleeping and drowsy souls, bound with
a double chain of earthliness and sin, is like the
electric touch of the angel on Peter, bound and
sleeping. They make us realize that we were
not only made to commune with God, but also
what a God He is with whom we may commune.
We talk of poetry, we talk of painting, we go to
the ends of the earth to see the artists and great
men of this world; but what a poet, what an
artist, is God! Truly said Michel Angelo, “The
true painting is only a copy of the divine perfections—a
shadow of his pencil.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Soul-striving.</div>

<p>The human soul seems to me an imprisoned
essence, striving after somewhat
divine. There is strength in it, as of suffocated
flame, finding vent now through poetry, now in
painting, now in music, sculpture, or architecture;
various are the crevices and fissures, but the
flame is one.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Shadow.</div>

<p>What a curious kind of thing shadow
is,—that invisible veil, falling so evenly and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
lightly over all things, bringing with it such
thoughts of calmness and rest. I wonder the old
Greeks did not build temples to Shadow, and call
her the sister of Thought and Peace. The
Hebrew writers speak of the “overshadowing
of the Almighty;” they call his protection “the
shadow of a great rock in a weary land.” Even
as the shadow of Mont Blanc falls like a Sabbath
across this valley, so falls the sense of his presence
across our weary life-road.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Heimweh.</div>

<p>Why? why this veil of dim and indefinable
anguish at sight of whatever is most fair,
at hearing whatever is most lovely? Is it the
exiled spirit, yearning for its own? Is it the
captive, to whom the ray of heaven’s own glory
comes through the crevice of his dungeon wall?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Seeing and
feeling.</div>

<p>It is not enough to open one’s eyes on
scenes; one must be able to be “en
rapport” with them. Just so in the spiritual
world, we sometimes   <em>see</em> great truths,—see that
God is beautiful and surpassingly lovely; but at
other times we   <em>feel</em> both nature and God, and O,
how different   <em>seeing</em> and   <em>feeling</em>!</p>


<h3 class="p3">POGANUC PEOPLE.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Longing

<p>There are hard, sinful, unlovely souls,
who yet long to be loved, who sigh in
their dark prison for that tenderness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
that devotion, of which they are consciously
unworthy. Love might redeem them; but who
can love them? There is a fable of a prince,
doomed by a cruel enchanter to wear a loathsome,
bestial form, till some fair woman should
redeem him by the transforming kiss of love.
The fable is a parable of the experience of many
a lost human soul....</p>

<p class="indent">Who can read the awful mysteries of a single
soul? We see human beings, hard, harsh, earthly,
and apparently without an aspiration for anything
high and holy; but let us never say that
there is not far down in the depths of any soul a
smothered aspiration, a dumb, repressed desire
to be something higher and purer, to attain the
perfectness to which God calls it.</p>

That gift will be more to her than beauty or

<p>Ah, the child is father of the man!

he will believe in what he sees and touches,—in
house, land, railroad stock,—he will believe in
these earnestly and really, and in his eternal
manhood nominally and partially. And when
his father’s messengers meet him, and face him
about, and take him off his darling pursuits, and
sweep his big ships into the fire, and crush his
full-grown cars, then the grown man will complain
and murmur, and wonder as the little man
does now. The Father wants the future, the
Child the present, all through life, till death

<p>When we look at the apparent recklessness
with which great sorrows seem to
be distributed among the children of the
earth, there is no way to keep our faith in a
Fatherly love, except to recognize how invariably
the sorrows that spring from love are a means of
enlarging and dignifying a human being. Nothing
great or good comes without birth-pangs, and
in just the proportion that natures grow more
noble their capacities of suffering increase.</p>

<p>“Doubt is very well as a sort of constitutional

if it runs on and gets to be chronic it breaks a
fellow up, and makes him morally spindling and
sickly. Men that   <em>do</em> anything in the world must
be men of strong convictions; it won’t do to go
through life like a hen, craw-crawing and lifting
up one foot, not knowing where to set it down
next.”</p>

<p>Do not our failures and mistakes often
come from discouragement? Does not every

failing courage? The saddest hours of life are
when we doubt ourselves. To sensitive, excitable
people, who expend nervous energy freely, must
come many such low tides. “Am I really a

<div class="sidenote">Ignorant
selfishness.</div>

<p>He was one of that class of people
who, of a freezing day, will plant themselves
directly between you and the fire, and then
stand and argue to prove that selfishness is the
root of all moral evil. Simeon said he always
had thought so; and his neighbors sometimes
supposed that nobody could enjoy better experimental
advantages for understanding the subject.
He was one of those men who suppose themselves
submissive to the divine will, to the uttermost
extent demanded by the extreme theology of
that day, simply because they have no nerves to
feel, no imagination to conceive, what endless
happiness or suffering is, and who deal therefore
with the great question of the salvation or damnation
of myriads as a problem of theological
algebra, to be worked out by their inevitable
x, y, z.</p>

<p>It is a hard condition of our existence

God will not let us have
heaven here below, but only such glimpses and
faint showings as parents sometimes give to children,
when they show them beforehand the jewelry
and pictures and stores of rare and curious treasures
which they hold for the possession of their
riper years. So it very often happens that the
man who has gone to bed an angel, feeling as if
all sin were forever vanquished, and he himself
immutably grounded in love, may wake the next
morning with a sick-headache, and, if he be not
careful, may scold about his breakfast like a miserable

broadly and heartily of this world that
their coming into a room always materializes the
conversation. We wish to be understood that
we mean no disparaging reflection on such persons;
they are as necessary to make up a world
as cabbages to make up a garden; the great,
healthy principles of cheerfulness and animal
life seem to exist in them in the gross; they are
wedges and ingots of solid, contented vitality.</p>

<p>These dear, good souls who wear their
life out for you, have they not a right
to scold you, and dictate to you, and tie up your
liberty, and make your life a burden to you? If
they have not, who has? If you complain, you
break their worthy old hearts. They insist on
the privilege of seeking your happiness by
thwarting you in everything you want to do, and

<p>Aunt Lois, as I have often said before,
was a good Christian, and held it her
duty to govern her tongue. True, she said many
sharp and bitter things; but nobody but herself
and her God knew how many more she would
have said had she not reined herself up in conscientious
silence. But never was there a woman
whose silence could express more contempt and
displeasure than hers. You could feel it in the
air about you, though she never said a word.
You could feel it in the rustle of her dress, in
the tap of her heels over the floor, in the occasional
flash of her sharp black eye. She was
like a thunder-cloud, whose quiet is portentous,
and from which you every moment expect a flash
or an explosion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life as a

<p>There are those people who possess a
peculiar faculty of mingling in the affairs
of this life as spectators as well as actors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
It does not, of course, suppose any coldness of
nature or want of human interest or sympathy,—nay,
it often exists more completely with
people of the tenderest human feeling. It rather
seems to be a kind of distinct faculty working
harmoniously with all the others; but he who
possesses it needs never to be at a loss for interest
or amusement; he is always a spectator at
a tragedy or a comedy, and sees in real life a
humor and a pathos beyond anything he can find
shadowed in books.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">A childlike

<p>Mrs. Pennel had one of those natures,
gentle, trustful, and hopeful, because not

the world, whose faith rests on childlike ignorance,
and who know not the deeper needs of
deeper natures; such see only the sunshine, and
forget the storm.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Unintended

<p>All that there was developed of him, at
present, was a fund of energy, self-esteem,
hope, courage, and daring, the love of
action, life, and adventure; his life was in the
outward and present, not in the inward and reflective;
he was a true ten-year-old boy, in its
healthiest and most animal perfection. What
she was, the small pearl with the golden hair,
with her frail and high-strung organization, her
sensitive nerves, her half-spiritual fibres, her ponderings,
and marvels, and dreams, her power of
love and yearning for self-devotion, our reader<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
may, perhaps, have seen. But if ever two children,
or two grown people, thus organized, are
thrown into intimate relations, it follows, from
the very laws of their being, that one must hurt
the other, simply by being itself; one must always
hunger for what the other has not to give.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty

<p>It is astonishing how much we think
about ourselves, yet to how little purpose;
how very clever people will talk
and wonder about themselves and each other, not
knowing how to use either themselves or each
other,—not having as much practical philosophy
in the matter of their own character and that of
their friends as they have in respect to the screws
of their gas-fixtures or the management of their
water-pipes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Reserve
not understood.</div>

<p>There are in every family circle individuals
whom a certain sensitiveness of
nature inclines to quietness and reserve;
and there are very well-meaning families where
no such quietness and reserve is possible. Nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
can be let alone, nobody may have a secret,
nobody can move in any direction, without a host
of inquiries and comments: “Who is your letter
from? Let’s see.”—“My letter is from So-and-so.”—“He
writing to you! I didn’t
know that. What’s he writing about?”—“Where
did you go yesterday? What did you
buy? What did you give for it? What are
you going to do with it?”—“Seems to me
that’s an odd way to do. I shouldn’t do so.”—“Look
here, Mary; Sarah’s going to have a
dress of silk tissue this spring. Now I think
they’re too dear, don’t you?”</p>

<p class="indent">I recollect seeing in some author a description
of a true gentleman, in which, among other
things, he was characterized as the man that asks
the fewest questions. This trait of refined society
might be adopted into home-life in a far
greater degree than it is, and make it far more
agreeable.</p>

<p class="indent">If there is perfect unreserve and mutual confidence,
let it show itself in free communications
coming unsolicited. It may fairly be presumed
that, if there is anything our intimate
friends wish us to know, they will tell us of it,
and that when we are in close and confidential
terms with persons, and there are topics on which
they do not speak to us, it is because for some
reason they prefer to keep silence concerning
them; and the delicacy that respects a friend’s
silence is one of the charms of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shyness of

<p>It comes far easier to scold our friend
in an angry moment than to say how

and go with their own force; love is shame-faced,
looks shyly out of the window, lingers long at the

<div class="sidenote">Throwing

<p>For the contentions that loosen the very
foundations of love, that crumble away
all its fine traceries and carved work,
about what miserable, worthless things do they
commonly begin! A dinner underdone, too much
oil consumed, a newspaper torn, a waste of coal
or soap, a dish broken!—and for this miserable
sort of trash, very good, very generous, very religious
people will sometimes waste and throw
away by double-handfuls the very thing for
which houses are built and all the paraphernalia
of a home established,—  <em>their happiness</em>. Better
cold coffee, smoky tea, burnt meat, better any
inconvenience, any loss, than a loss of   <em>love</em>; and
nothing so surely turns away love as constant
fault-finding.</p>

<hr class="tb">

thunder-storm with lightning and hail. All these are worse
than useless; they are positive <em>sins</em>, by whomsoever
indulged,—sins as great and real as many that<span class="pagenum"

these are for the most part but the venting on our fellow-beings

things cheap! Understand me, now. I don’t
mean the love of getting cheap things, by which
one understands showy, trashy, ill-made, spurious
articles, bearing certain apparent resemblances to
better things. All really sensible people are
quite superior to that sort of cheapness. But
those fortunate accidents which put within the
power of a man things really good and valuable
for half or a third of their value, what mortal
virtue and resolution can withstand?</p>

which must be turned out for if one wishes to
avoid a collision. All Miss Debby’s opinions
had been made up, catalogued, and arranged at
a very early period of life, and she had no
thought of change. She moved in a region of
certainties, and always took her own opinions for
granted with a calm supremacy altogether above
reason. Yet there was all the while about her
a twinkle of humorous consciousness, a vein of

<p>It is a charming thing, in one’s rambles,
to come across a tree, or a flower, or a
fine bit of landscape that we can think
of afterwards, and feel richer for its being in
the world. But it is more, when one is in a
strange place, to come across a man that you feel
thoroughly persuaded is, somehow or other,
morally and intellectually worth exploring. Our
lives tend to become so hopelessly commonplace,
and the human beings we meet are generally so
much one just like another, that the possibility
of a new and peculiar style of character in an
acquaintance is a most enlivening one.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Unsuspected

<p>The man who has begun to live and
work by artificial stimulant never
knows where he stands, and can never count upon
himself with any certainty. He lets into his
castle a servant who becomes the most tyrannical
of masters. He may resolve to turn him out,
but will find himself reduced to the condition in
which he can neither do with nor without him.</p>

<p>In short, the use of stimulant to the brain
power brings on a disease in whose paroxysms a
man is no more his own master than in the ravings
of fever, a disease that few have the knowledge
to understand, and for whose manifestations
the world has no pity.</p>

<p>Out of every ten young men who begin

up and sleeping this serpent, destined in after
years to be the deadly tyrant of their life—this
curse, unappeasable by tears, or prayers, or
agonies—with whom the struggle is like that of

<p>A great deal of good sermonizing, by

is denounced as one of the seven deadly sins of
society; but, after all, gossip has its better side;
if not a Christian grace, it certainly is one of
those weeds which show a good warm soil.</p>

<p class="indent">The kindly heart, that really cares for everything
human it meets, inclines toward gossip in a
good way. Just as a morning-glory throws out
tendrils, and climbs up and peeps cheerily into

the opening and shutting of your blinds, and
the curling smoke from your chimney.</p>

leave behind them wherever they operate.</p>

<p class="indent">They are often what the world calls well-meaning
people, animated by a most benevolent
spirit, and have no more intention of giving
offence than a nettle has of stinging. A large,
vigorous, well-growing nettle has no consciousness
of the stings it leaves in the delicate hands that
have been in contact with it; it has simply acted
out its innocent and respectable nature as a
nettle. But a nettle armed with the power of
locomotion on an ambulatory tour, is something
the results of which may be fearful to contemplate.</p>

<p>“You girls and women don’t know your

Gospel. You have always had a strange power
over us boys. You never talked religion much,
but I have seen high fellows come away from
being with you as still and quiet as one feels
when he goes into a church. I can’t understand
all the hang of predestination and moral ability,
and natural ability, and God’s efficiency, and
man’s agency, which Dr. Hopkins is so engaged

were not clean? Well, it’s just like that with me. Your presence
makes me feel that I am not pure,—that I am low and unworthy,—not
worthy to touch the hem of your garment. Your good Dr. Hopkins
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> 
spent a whole half day, the other Sunday, trying to tell us about the
beauty of holiness; and he cut, and pared, and peeled, and sliced,
and told us what it wasn’t; and what was <em>like it</em>, and wasn’t;
and then he built up an exact definition, and fortified and
bricked it up all round; and I thought to myself that he’d better
tell ’em to look at Mary Scudder, and they’d understand all about
it.”</p>

called the Grot of Rainbows? Whoever stands
on a rock in that grotto sees himself in the centre
of a rainbow-circle, above, below, around.
In like manner, merry, chatty, positive, busy,
house-wifely Katy saw herself standing in a rainbow-shrine
in her lover’s inner soul, and liked to
see herself so. A woman, by-the-bye, must be
very insensible, who is not moved to come upon
a higher plane of being herself, by seeing how
undoubtingly she is insphered in the heart of a
good and noble man. A good man’s faith in
you, fair lady, if you ever have it, will make
you better and nobler even before you know it.</p>

<p>If women have one weakness more
marked than another, it is towards veneration.
They are born worshippers.... The
fact is, women are burdened with fealty, faith,
and reverence, more than they know what to do
with; they stand like a hedge of sweet-peas,
throwing out fluttering tendrils everywhere for
something high and strong to climb by,—and
when they find it, be it ever so rough in the
bark, they catch upon it. And instances are not
wanting of those who have turned away from
the flattery of admirers to prostrate themselves
at the feet of a genuine hero who never wooed
them, except by heroic deeds and the rhetoric of
a noble life.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Mother-love

<p>None of the peculiar developments of
the female nature have a more exquisite
vitality than the sentiment of a frail,
delicate, repressed, timid woman, for a strong,
manly, generous son. There is her ideal expressed;
there is the outspeaking and outacting
of all she trembles to think, yet burns to say or
do; here is the hero that shall speak for her, the
heart into which she has poured hers, and that
shall give to her tremulous and hidden aspirations
a strong and victorious expression. “I have
gotten a   <em>man</em> from the Lord,” she says to herself,
and each outburst of his manliness, his vigor,
his self-confidence, his superb vitality, fills her
with a strange, wondering pleasure, and she has
a secret tenderness and pride even in his wilfulness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
and waywardness.... First love of womanhood
is something wonderful and mysterious,—but
in this second love it rises again, idealized
and refined; she loves the father and herself
united and made one in this young heir of life
and hope.</p>

<p>Her large brown eyes had an eager joy

to calm down again, and she received her only
with that placid, sincere air which was her habit.
Everything about this woman showed an ardent
soul, repressed by timidity and by a certain
dumbness in the faculties of outward expression;
but her eyes had, at times, that earnest, appealing
language which is so pathetic in the silence

there be one she once knew well whose name she
never speaks,—if she seems to have an instinct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
to avoid every occasion of its mention,—if
when you speak, she drops into silence and
changes the subject,—why, look there for something!
just so, when going through deep meadow-grass,
a bird flies ostentatiously up before you,
you may know her nest is not there, but far off,

there are some women of this habit; there is no
independence and pertinacity of opinion like that

is so easy to silence, and so difficult to convince.
Mara, little and unformed as she yet was, belonged

measuring rod, which she was laying to the

while they have houses, have no homes,—see
from afar, in their distant, bleak life-journey, the

unskilled and rude hands minister to her cultivated

such a home, with such a mistress, no sirens will
seduce a man, even though the hair grow gray,

about her person alone in the days of courtship
seems in the course of years to have interfused

and which in every detail is only an expression

<h3 class="p3">THE MAYFLOWER.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">A perfect
character.</div>

<p>“Was she beautiful?” you ask. I also
will ask one question: “If an angel
from heaven should dwell in human form, and
animate any human face, would not that face be
lovely? It might not be   <em>beautiful</em>, but would it
not be lovely?” She was not beautiful except
after this fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">How well I remember her, as she used sometimes
to sit thinking, with her head resting on
her hand, her face mild and placid, with a quiet
October sunshine in her blue eyes, and an ever-present
smile over her whole countenance. I
remember the sudden sweetness of look when
any one spoke to her; the prompt attention, the
quick comprehension of things before you uttered
them, the obliging readiness to leave for you
whatever she was doing.</p>

<p class="indent">To those who mistake occasional pensiveness
for melancholy, it might seem strange to say that
my Aunt Mary was always happy. Yet she was
so. Her spirits never rose to buoyancy, and
never sunk to despondency. I know that it is
an article in the sentimental confession of faith
that such a character cannot be interesting. For
this impression there is some ground. The placidity
of a medium, commonplace mind is uninteresting,
but the placidity of a strong and well
governed one borders on the sublime. Mutability
of emotion characterizes inferior orders of being;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
but He who combines all interest, all excitement,
all perfection, is “the same yesterday, to-day, and
forever.” And if there be anything sublime in the
idea of an Almighty Mind, in perfect peace itself,
and, therefore, at leisure to bestow all its energies
on the wants of others, there is at least a reflection
of the same sublimity in the character of
that human being who has so quieted and governed
the world within that nothing is left to
absorb sympathy or distract attention from those
around.</p>

<p class="indent">Such a woman was my Aunt Mary. Her
placidity was not so much the result of temperament
as of choice. She had every susceptibility
of suffering incident to the noblest and most
delicate constitution of mind; but they had been
so directed that, instead of concentrating thought
on self, they had prepared her to understand and
feel for others.</p>

<p class="indent">She was, beyond all things else, a sympathetic
person, and her character, like the green in a
landscape, was less remarkable for what it was
in itself than for its perfect and beautiful harmony
with all the coloring and shading around
it.</p>

<p class="indent">Other women have had talents, others have
been good; but no woman that ever I knew

condemned to the society of a person who can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
never understand anything you say unless you
say the whole of it, making your commas and
periods as you go along; and the most desirable

saves you all the trouble of talking by knowing
just what you mean before you begin to speak.</p>

tempted, betrayed, almost to ruin, and a few

of us may remember respectable, well-meaning
people, with whom in our mature years we live
in perfect amity, but who in our childhood appear
to us bitter enemies. Children are remarkably
helpless in this respect, because they cannot
choose their company and surroundings as grown

unsympathetic that they may almost be said to

the earth before him, and are using it, and determined
to go on using it, for their own behoof

to push in his little individuality, and seize his

the heart wrong; the same longing for something
which should touch it aright; the same
discontent with latent, matter-of-course affection,
and the same craving for sympathy, which
has been the unprofitable fashion of this world
in all ages. And no human being possessing
such constitutionals has a better chance of being
made unhappy by them than the backward, uninteresting,
wrong-doing child. We can all sympathize,
to some extent, with   <em>men</em> and   <em>women</em>;
but how few can go back to the sympathies of
childhood; can understand the desolate insignificance
of not being one of the   <em>grown-up</em>
people; of being sent to bed, to be   <em>out of the way</em>
in the evening, and to school, to be out of the

<p>It seems to me that lovely and loving

and holy an estate that it would be a beautiful
thing in heaven to have a band of heavenly children,
guileless, gay, and forever joyous—tender
spring blossoms of the Kingdom of Light. Was

drop everything at a moment’s warning from
any of my half-dozen seniors. “Here, Hal, run
down cellar and get me a dozen apples,” my
brother would say, just as I had half-built a
block-house. “Harry, run upstairs and get the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
book I left on the bed”—“Harry, run out to
the barn and get the rake I left there”—“Here,
Harry, carry this up garret”—“Harry, run out
to the tool-shop and get that”—were sounds
constantly occurring—breaking up my private,
cherished little enterprise of building cob-houses,
making mill-dams and bridges, or loading carriages,
or driving horses. Where is the mature
Christian who could bear with patience the interruptions

<div class="sidenote">Repression.</div>

<p>When children grow up among older
people, and are pushed and jostled and set aside
in the more engrossing interests of their elders,
there is an almost incredible amount of timidity
and dumbness of nature, with regard to the
expression of inward feeling,—and yet, often at
this time, the instinctive sense of pleasure and
pain is fearfully acute. But the child has imperfectly
learned language; his stock of words,
as yet, consists only in names and attributes of
outward and physical objects, and he has no
phraseology with which to embody a mere emotional
experience.</p>

class. Meanwhile the Creator, who is the greatest

  <em>both</em> a physical system, needing to be kept in
order by physical labor, and an intellectual or
brain power, needing to be kept in order by

<p>It is a great mistake to call nothing intemperance
but that degree of physical
excitement which completely overthrows the
mental powers. There is a state of nervous
excitability, resulting from what is often called
moderate stimulation, which often long precedes
this, and is, in regard to it, like the premonitory
warnings of the fatal cholera—an unsuspected
draft on the vital powers, from which, at any
moment, they may sink into irremediable collapse.</p>

<p>It is in this state, often, that the spirit of
gambling or of wild speculation is induced by the
morbid cravings of an over-stimulated system.
Unsatisfied with the healthy and regular routine
of business, and the laws of gradual and solid
prosperity, the excited and unsteady imagination
leads its subjects to daring risks, with the alternative
of unbounded gain on the one side, or of
utter ruin on the other. And when, as is too

responsibility on to the Sunday-school teacher,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
and suppose, of course, if they send their children
to Sunday-school, they do the best they can for
them. Now, I am satisfied, from my experience
as a Sabbath-school teacher, that the best religious
instruction imparted abroad still stands in
need of the coöperation of a systematic plan of
religious discipline and instruction at home; for,
after all, God gives a power to the efforts of a

<div class="sidenote">The turning-point

<p>There is an age when the waves of

<div class="sidenote">“What

<p>But, after all, Charley is not to be
wholly shirked, for he is an institution,
a solemn and awful   <em>fact</em>; and on the
answer of the question, What is to be done with
him? depends a future. Many a hard, morose,
and bitter man has come from a Charley turned
off and neglected; many a parental heartache
has come from a Charley left to run the streets,
that mamma and sisters might play on the piano
and write letters in peace. It is easy to get rid
of him—there are fifty ways of doing that—he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
is a spirit that can be promptly laid for a
season, but if not laid aright, will come back by
and by a strong man armed, when you cannot
send him off at pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">Mamma and sisters had better pay a little tax
to Charley now, than a terrible one by and by.
There is something significant in the old English
phrase, with which our Scriptures make us familiar,—a
  <em>man</em> child! A   <em>man</em> child! There you
have the word that should make you think more
than twice before you answer the question, What
shall we do with Charley?</p>

<p class="indent">For to-day he is at your feet—to-day you can
make him laugh; you can make him cry; you can
persuade, and coax, and turn him to your pleasure;
you can make his eyes fill and his bosom
swell with recitals of good and noble deeds; in
short, you can mold him, if you will take the
trouble.</p>

<p class="indent">But look ahead some years, when that little
voice shall ring in deep bass tones; when that
small foot shall have a man’s weight and tramp;
when a rough beard shall cover that little round
chin, and all the strength of manhood fill out
that little form. Then, you would give worlds
to have the key to his heart, to be able to turn
and guide him to your will; but if you lose that
key now he is little, you may search for it carefully
with tears some other day, and not find it.
Old housekeepers have a proverb that one hour
lost in the morning is never found all day—it
has a significance in this case.</p>

coarseness and indelicacy, a fair preparation to
enable him to be the intimate companion of a

from Asphyxia’s bedroom window a brave sight,
if there had been any eyes to enjoy it,—a range
of rocky cliffs with little pin-feathers of black
pine upon them, and behind them the sky all
aflame with bars of massy light,—orange and
crimson and burning gold,—and long bright
rays, darting hither and thither, touched now the
window of a farmhouse, which seemed to kindle
and flash back a morning salutation; now they hit
a tall, scarlet maple, now they pierced between
clumps of pine, making their black edges flame

<div class="sidenote">October in

<p>Nature in New England is, for the most

keen, relentless, energetic. She runs through the
seasons a merciless express-train, on which you
may jump if you can, at her hours, but which
knocks you down remorselessly if you come in
her way, and leaves you hopelessly behind if you
are late. Only for a few brief weeks in the
autumn does this grim, belligerent female condescend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
to be charming; but when she does set
about it, the veriest Circe of enchanted isles
could not do it better. Airs more dreamy, more
hazy, more full of purple light and lustre, never
lay over Cyprus or Capri, than those which each
October overshadow the granite rocks and prickly
chestnuts of New England. The trees seem to
run no longer sap, but some strange liquid glow;
the colors of the flowers flame up, from the cold,
pallid delicacy of spring, into royal tints wrought
of the very fire of the sun, and the hues of evening
clouds. The humblest weed, which we trod
under our foot, unnoticed, in summer, changes
with the first frost into some colored marvel,
and lifts itself up into a study for a painter, just
as the touch of death or adversity strikes out in
a rough nature traits of nobleness and delicacy
before wholly undreamed of.</p>

knew it, we should find their life’s experience
recorded in them. Our oak—what a crop of
meditations and remembrances must he have
thrown forth, leafing out century after century!
Awhile he spake and thought only of red deer
and Indians; of the trillium that opened its
white triangle in his shade; of the scented arbutus,
fair as the pink ocean shell, weaving her
fragrant mats in the moss at his feet; of feathery
ferns, casting their silent shadows on the checkerberry
leaves, and all those sweet, wild, nameless,
half-mossy things that live in the gloom of
forests, and are only desecrated when brought to
scientific light, laid out, and stretched on a botanic
bier. Sweet old forest days! when blue
jay, and yellow-hammer, and bobolink made his
leaves merry, and summer was a long opera of
such music as Mozart dimly dreamed. But then
came human kind bustling beneath; wondering,
fussing, exploring, measuring, treading down
flowers, cutting down trees, scaring bobolinks,

<div class="sidenote">The brook

<p>Let us stop the old chaise and get out a
minute to look at this brook,—one of
our last summer’s pets. What is he doing this
winter? Let us at least say “How do you do?”
to him. Ah, here he is! and he and Jack Frost
together have been turning the little gap in the
old stone wall, through which he leaped down
to the road, into a little grotto of Antiparos.
Some old rough rails and boards that dropped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
over it are sheathed in plates of transparent
silver. The trunks of the black alders are
mailed with crystal; and the witch-hazel and
yellow osiers fringing its sedgy borders are likewise
shining through their glossy covering.
Around every stem that rises from the water is
a glittering ring of ice. The tags of the alder
and the red berries of last summer’s wild roses
glitter now like a lady’s pendant. As for the
brook, he is wide-awake and joyful; and where
the roof of sheet ice breaks away, you can see his
yellow-brown waters rattling and gurgling among
the stones as briskly as they did last July. Down
he springs! over the glossy-coated stone wall,
throwing new sparkles into the fairy grotto
around him; and widening daily from melting
snows, and such other godsends, he goes chattering
off under yonder mossy stone bridge, and we
lose sight of him. It might be fancy, but it
seemed that our watery friend tipped us a cheery
wink as he passed, saying, “Fine weather, sir
and madam; nice times these; and in April
you’ll find us all right; the flowers are making
up their finery for the next season; there’s to
be a splendid display in a month or two.”</p>

grand and beautiful anatomy of the tree, with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
its interlacing network of boughs, knotted on
each twig with the buds of next year’s promise.
The fleecy and rosy clouds look all the more
beautiful through the dark lace veil of yonder
magnificent elms; and the down-drooping drapery
of yonder willow hath its own grace of outline
as it sweeps the bare snows. And the comical
old apple-trees, why, in summer they look
like so many plump, green cushions, one as much
like another as possible; but under the revealing
light of winter every characteristic twist and
jerk stands disclosed.</p>

<p>One might moralize on this,—how affliction,

more awful than can be created by the action of
any common causes of sterility. There, immense
tracts sloping gradually upward show a desolation
so peculiar, so utterly unlike every common
solitude of nature, that one enters upon it with
the shudder we give at that which is wholly unnatural.
On all sides are gigantic serpent convolutions
of black lava, their immense folds rolled
into every conceivable contortion, as if, in their
fiery agonies, they had struggled, and wreathed
and knotted together, and then grown cold and
black with the imperishable signs of those terrific
convulsions upon them. Not a blade of grass,
not a flower, not even the hardiest lichen, springs
up to relieve the utter deathliness of the scene.
The eye wanders from one black, shapeless mass
to another, and there is ever the same suggestion
of hideous monster life—of goblin convulsions
and strange fiend-like agonies in some age
gone by. One’s very footsteps have an unnatural,
metallic clink, and one’s garments brushing

<p>In New England, Nature is an up-and-down,
smart, decisive house-mother, that
has her times and seasons, and brings up
her ends of life with a positive jerk. She will
have no shilly-shally. When her time comes, she
clears off the gardens and forests thoroughly and
once for all, and they are clean. Then she freezes
the ground solid as iron, and then she covers all
up with a nice, pure winding-sheet of snow, and
seals matters up as a good housewife does her
jelly-tumblers under white paper covers. There
you are, fast and cleanly. If you have not got
ready for it, so much the worse for you! If
your tender roots are not taken up, your cellar
banked, your doors listed, she can’t help it; it’s
your own lookout, not hers.</p>

<p class="indent">But Nature down here is an easy, demoralized,
indulgent old grandmother, who has no particular
time for anything, and does everything when
she happens to feel like it. “Is it winter, or

swaying avenues are like a scene in fairy-land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The right
side and
the wrong.</div>

<p>Every place, like a bit of tapestry, has
its right side and its wrong side; and
both are true and real,—the wrong
side with its rags and tags, and seams and knots,
and thrums of worsted, and the right side with
its pretty picture.</p>


<h3 class="p3">SUNNY MEMORIES OF FOREIGN LANDS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Beauty in
nature.</div>

<p>“Turn off my eyes from beholding vanity,”
says a good man, when he sees a
display of graceful ornament. What, then, must
he think of the Almighty Being, all whose useful
work is so overlaid with ornament? There is
not a fly’s leg, not an insect’s wing, which is not
polished and decorated to an extent that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
should think positive extravagance in finishing
up a child’s dress. And can we suppose that
this Being can take delight in dwellings and
modes of life and forms of worship where everything
is reduced to cold, naked utility? I think
not. The instinct to adorn and beautify is from
Him; it likens us to Him, and if rightly understood,
instead of being a siren to beguile our
hearts away, it will be the closest affiliating
band.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Flowers.</div>

<p>There is a strange, unsatisfying pleasure
about flowers, which, like all earthly pleasures,
is akin to pain. What can you do with
them?—you want to do something, but what?
Take them all up and carry them with you?
You cannot do that. Get down and look at
them? What, keep a whole caravan waiting for
your observation? That will never do. Well,
then, pick and carry them along with you. That
is what, in despair of any better resource, I
did.... It seemed almost sacrilegious to tear
away such fanciful creations, that looked as if
they were votive offerings on an altar, or, more
likely, living existences, whose only conscious life
was a continual exhalation of joy and praise.</p>

<p class="indent">These flowers seemed to me to be the Earth’s
raptures and aspirations,—her better moments—her
lucid intervals. Like everything else in
our existence, they are mysterious.</p>

<p class="indent">In what mood of mind were they conceived by
the great Artist? Of what feelings of His are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
they the expression,—springing up out of the
dust, in the gigantic, waste, and desolate regions,
where one would think the sense of His almightiness
might overpower the soul? Born in the
track of the glacier and the avalanche, they seem
to say to us that this Almighty Being is very
pitiful, and of tender compassion; that, in His
infinite soul, there is an exquisite gentleness and
love of the beautiful, and that, if we would be
blessed, His will to bless is infinite.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Mountain
air.</div>

<p>I look at the strange, old, cloudy mountains,
the Eiger, the Wetterhorn, the
Schreckhorn. A kind of hazy ether floats around
them—an indescribable aerial halo—which no
painter ever represents. Who can paint the air,—that
vivid blue in which these sharp peaks cut
their glittering images?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The mysterious
in
nature.</div>

<p>I like best these snow-pure glaciers seen
through these black pines; there is
something mysterious about them when
you thus catch glimpses, and see not the earthly
base on which they rest. I recollect the same
fact in seeing the cataract of Niagara through
trees, where merely the dizzying fall of water
was visible, with its foam, and spray, and rainbow;
it produced an idea of something supernatural....</p>

<p class="indent">Every prospect loses by being made definite.
As long as we only see a thing by glimpses, and
imagine that there is a deal more that we do   <em>not</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
see, the mind is kept in a constant excitement
and play; but come to a point where you can
fairly and squarely take in the whole, and there
your mind falls listless. It is the greatest proof,
to me, of the infinite nature of our minds, that
we almost instantly undervalue what we have
thoroughly attained.... I remember once, after
finishing a very circumstantial treatise on the
nature of heaven, being oppressed with a similar
sensation of satiety,—that which hath not entered
the heart of man to conceive must not be mapped
out,—hence the wisdom of the dim, indefinite
imagery of the Scriptures; they give you no hard
outline, no definite limit; occasionally they part
as do the clouds around these mountains, giving
you flashes and gleams of something supernatural
and splendid, but never fully unveiling.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Cloud landscapes.</div>

<p>It is odd, though, to look at those cloud-caperings;
quite as interesting, in its
way, as to read new systems of transcendental
philosophy, and perhaps quite as profitable.
Yonder is a great white-headed cloud, slowly
unrolling himself in the bosom of a black pine
forest. Across the other side of the road a huge
granite cliff has picked up a bit of gauzy silver,
which he is winding around his scraggy neck.
And now, here comes a cascade, right over our
heads; a cascade, not of water, but of cloud;
for the poor little brook that makes it faints away
before it gets down to us; it falls like a shimmer
of moonlight, or a shower of powdered silver,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
while a tremulous rainbow appears at uncertain
intervals, like a half-seen spirit.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">A cascade.</div>

<p>The cascade here, as in mountains generally,
is a never-failing source of life and
variety. Water, joyous, buoyant son of Nature,
is calling to you, leaping, sparkling, mocking at
you between bushes, and singing as he goes down
the dells. A thousand little pictures he makes
among the rocks as he goes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Phases of
nature.</div>

<p>There are phases in nature which correspond
to every phase of human
thought and emotion; and this stern, cloudy
scenery [in the Alps] answers to the melancholy
fatalism of Greek tragedy, or the kindred
mournfulness of the book of Job.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Sublimity
in nature.</div>

<p>Coming down I mentally compared Mont
Blanc and Niagara, as one should compare
two grand pictures in different styles of the
same master. Both are of that class of things
which mark eras in a mind’s history, and open a
new door which no man can shut. Of the two,
I think Niagara is the more impressive, perhaps
because those aerial elements of foam and spray
give that vague and dreamy indefiniteness of
outline which seems essential in the sublime. For
this reason, while Niagara is equally impressive
in the distance, it does not lose on the nearest
approach,—it is always mysterious, and therefore
stimulating. Those varying spray-wreaths,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
rising like Ossian’s ghosts from its abyss; those
shimmering rainbows, through whose veil you
look; those dizzying falls of water that seem like
clouds poured from the hollow of God’s hand;
and that mystic undertone of sound that seems
to pervade the whole being as the voice of the
Almighty,—all these bewilder and enchant the
discriminating and prosaic part of us, and bring
us into that cloudy region of ecstasy where the
soul comes nearest to Him whom no eye has seen
or can see. I have sometimes asked myself if,
in the countless ages of the future, the heirs of
God shall ever be endowed by Him with a creative
power, by which they shall bring into being
things like these? In this infancy of his existence,
man creates pictures, statues, cathedrals;
but when he is made “ruler over many things,”
will his Father intrust to him the building and
adorning of worlds? the ruling of the glorious,
dazzling forces of nature?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Mountain
brooks.</div>

<p>Everybody knows, even in our sober
New England, that mountain brooks are
a frisky, indiscreet set, rattling, chattering, and
capering, in defiance of all law and order, tumbling
over precipices and picking themselves up
at the bottom, no whit wiser or more disposed to
be tranquil than they were at the top; in fact,
seeming to grow more mad and frolicsome with
every leap. Well, that is just the way brooks
do here in the Alps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Alpine air.</div>

<p>The whole air seemed to be surcharged
with tints, ranging between the palest rose and
the deepest violet—tints never without blue,
and never without red, but varying in the degree
of the two. It is this prismatic hue, diffused over
every object, which gives one of the most noticeable
characteristics of the Alpine landscape.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Color-blending.</div>

<p>I have seen sometimes, in spring, set
against a deep-blue sky, an array of
greens, from lightest yellow to deepest blue of
the pines, tipped and glittering with the afternoon
sun, yet so swathed in some invisible, harmonizing
medium, that the strong contrasts of
color jarred upon no sense. All seemed to be
bound by the invisible cestus of some celestial
Venus. Yet what painter would dare attempt
the same?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Nature’s
anguish.</div>

<p>Mountains are nature’s testimonials of
anguish. They are the sharp cry of a
groaning and travailing creation. Nature’s stern
agony writes itself on these furrowed brows of
gloomy stone. These reft and splintered crags
stand, the dreary images of patient sorrow, existing
verdureless and stern because exist they
must. In them, hearts that have ceased to
rejoice, and have learned to suffer, find kindred,
and here an earth worn with countless cycles of
sorrow utters to the stars voices of speechless
despair.</p>

<h3 class="p3">POGANUC PEOPLE.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">New England
spring.</div>

<p>But at last—at last—spring did come
at Poganuc! This marvel and mystery
of the new creation   <em>did</em> finally take place there
every year, in spite of every appearance to the
contrary. Long after the bluebird that had
sung the first promise had gone back into his own
celestial ether, the promise that he sang was fulfilled.</p>

<p class="indent">Like those sweet, foreseeing spirits, that on
high, bare tree-tops of human thought, pour
forth songs of hope in advance of their age and
time, our bluebird was gifted with a sure spirit
of prophecy; and, though the winds were angry
and loud, though snows lay piled and deep for
long weeks after, though ice and frost and hail
armed themselves in embattled forces, yet the
sun behind them all kept shining and shining,
every day longer and longer, every day drawing
nearer and nearer, till the snows passed away
like a bad dream, and the brooks woke up and
began to laugh and gurgle, and the ice went out
of the ponds. Then the pussy-willows threw out
their soft catkins, and the ferns came up with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
their woolly hoods on, like prudent old house-mothers,
looking to see if it was yet time to
unveil their tender greens, and the white blossoms
of the shad-blow and the tremulous tags of
the birches and alders shook themselves gayly
out in the woods. Then, under brown, rustling
leaf-banks, came the white, waxy shells of the
trailing arbutus with its pink buds, fair as a winter’s
dawn on snow; the blue and white hepaticas
opened their eyes, and cold, sweet, white violets
starred the moist edges of water-courses, and
great blue violets opened large eyes in the shadows,
and the white and crimson trilliums unfurled
under the flickering lace-work shadows of
the yet leafless woods; the red columbine waved
its bells from the rocks, and great tufts of golden
cowslips fringed the borders of the brooks.
Then came in flocks the delicate wind-flower
family; anemones, starry white, and the crowfoot,
with its pink outer shell, and the spotted
adder’s tongue, with its waving yellow bells of
blossom. Then, too, the honest, great, green
leaves of the old skunk-cabbage, most refreshing
to the eye in its hardy, succulent greenness,
though an abomination to the nose of the ill-informed
who should be tempted to gather them.
In a few weeks, the woods, late so frozen,—hopelessly
buried in snow-drifts,—were full of a
thousand beauties and delicacies of life and motion,
and flowers bloomed on every hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Autumn.</div>

<p>The bright days of summer were a
short-lived joy at Poganuc. One hardly had
time to say “How beautiful!” before it was
past. By September came the frosty nights
that turned the hills into rainbow colors, and
ushered in Autumn, with her gorgeous robes of
golden-rod and purple asters. There was still
the best of sport for the children, however; for
the frost ripened the shagbark walnuts and
opened the chestnut burrs, and the glossy brown
chestnuts dropped down among the rustling yellow
leaves and the beds of fringed blue gentian....
Here and there groups of pines and tall
hemlocks, with their heavy background of solemn
green, threw out the flamboyant tracery of
the forest in startling distinctness. Here and
there, as they passed a bit of low land, the
swamp maple seemed really to burn like crimson
flame, and the clumps of black alder, with their
vivid scarlet berries, exalted the effect of color
to the very highest and most daring result. No
artist ever has ventured to put on canvas the
exact copy of the picture that Nature paints for
us every year in the autumn months. There
are things the Almighty Artist can do that no
earthly imitator can more than hopelessly admire.</p>

winter.</div>

<p>By and by the sun took to getting up
later and later, setting a dreadfully bad
example, it is to be confessed. It
would be seven o’clock and after before he would
show his red face above the bed-clothes of clouds
away off in the southeast; and when he   <em>did</em>
manage to get up, he was so far off and so chilly
in his demeanor that people seemed scarcely a
bit the better for him; and by half-past four in
the afternoon he was down in bed again, tucked
up for the night, never caring what became of
the world. And so the clouds were full of snow,
as if a thousand white feather-beds had been
ripped up over the world; and all the frisky
winds came out of their dens, and great frolics
they had, blowing and roaring and careering in
the clouds,—now bellowing down between the
mountains, as if they meant to tear the world to
pieces, then piping high and shrill, first round
one corner of the farmhouse, and then round
the other, rattling the windows, bouncing against
the doors, and then with one united chorus rumbling,
tumbling down the great chimney, as if
they had a mind to upset it. Oh, what a frisky,
rough, jolly, unmannerly set of winds they were!
By and by the snow drifted higher than the
fences, and nothing was to be seen around the
farmhouse but smooth, waving hills and hollows
of snow; and then came the rain and sleet, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
froze them over with a slippery, shining crust,
that looked as if the earth was dressed for the

seen Susan clear away the cobwebs in your

<p>The mutual acquaintance that comes to

by the factitious circumstances of society.
When the whole artificial world is withdrawn,
and far out of sight, when we are surrounded
with the pure and beautiful mysteries of nature,
the very best and most genuine part of us comes
to the surface, we know each other by the communion
of our very highest faculties.</p>

<h3>THE MINISTER’S WOOING.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Romance.</div>

<p>All prosaic and all bitter, disenchanted
people talk as if poets and novelists   <em>made</em> romances.
They do, just as much as craters make
volcanoes, no more. What is romance? Whence
comes it? Plato spoke to the subject wisely, in
his quaint way, some two thousand years ago,
when he said, “Man’s soul, in a former state,
was winged and soared among the gods: and
so it comes to pass that, in this life, when the
soul, by the power of music or poetry, or the
sight of beauty, hath her remembrance quickened,
forthwith there is a struggling and a pricking
pain, as of wings trying to come forth, even
as children in teething.” And if an old heathen,
two thousand years ago, discoursed thus gravely
of the romantic part of our nature, whence comes
it that in Christian lands we think in so pagan a
way of it, and turn the whole care of it to ballad-makers,
romancers, and opera-singers?</p>

<p class="indent">Let us look up in fear and reverence, and say,
“God is the great maker of romance; He, from
whose hand came man and woman,—He, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
strung the great harp of existence,—He is the
great poet of life.” Every impulse of beauty, of
heroism, and every craving for purer love, fairer
perfection, nobler type and style of being, than
that which closes like a prison-house around us,
in the dim, daily walk of life, is God’s breath,
God’s impulse, God’s reminder to the soul that
there is something higher, sweeter, purer, yet to
be attained....</p>

<p class="indent">The dullest street of the most prosaic town
has matter in it for more smiles, more tears,
more intense excitement, than ever were written
in story or sung in poem; the reality is there, of
which the romance is the second-hand recorder.</p>


<h3 class="p3">OLDTOWN FOLKS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Hebrew
literature.</div>

<p>But it is a most remarkable property of
this old Hebrew literature that it seems
to be enchanted with a divine and living power,
which strikes the nerve of individual consciousness
in every desolate and suffering soul. It may
have been Judah or Jerusalem ages ago to whom
these words first came, but as they have traveled
on for thousands of years, they have seemed to
tens of thousands of sinking and desolate souls
the voice of God to them individually. They have
raised the burden from thousands of crushed
spirits; they have been as the day-spring to thousands
of perplexed wanderers. Oh! let us treasure
these old words, for as of old Jehovah chose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
to dwell in a tabernacle in the wilderness, and
between the cherubim in the temple, so now He
dwells in them; and to the simple soul that
seeks for Him here, He will look forth as of old
from the pillar of cloud and fire.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Influence
of the
Bible.</div>

<p>For my part, I am impatient of the
theory of those who think that nothing
that is not understood makes any
valuable impression on the mind of a child. I
am certain that the constant contact of the Bible
with my childish mind was a very great mental
stimulant, as it certainly was a cause of a singular
and vague pleasure. The wild, poetic parts
of the prophecies, with their bold figures, vivid
exclamations, and strange Oriental names and
images, filled me with a quaint and solemn delight.
Just as a child brought up under the
shadow of the great cathedrals of the Old World,
wandering into them daily, at morning, or at
eventide, beholding the many-colored windows,
flamboyant with strange legends of saints and
angels, and neither understanding the legends,
nor comprehending the architecture, is yet stilled
and impressed, till the old minster grows into his
growth and fashions his nature, so this wonderful
old cathedral book insensibly wrought a sort of
mystical poetry into the otherwise hard and sterile
life of New England. Its passionate Oriental
phrases, its quaint, pathetic stories, its wild transcendent
bursts of imagery, fixed an indelible
mark in my imagination.... I think no New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
Englander, brought up under the  <i lang="fr">régime</i> established
by the Puritans, could really estimate how
much of himself had actually been formed by
this constant, face-to-face intimacy with Hebrew
literature.</p>

<p>“But don’t you think,” said Marianne,
“that there is danger in too much
fiction?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span></p>

<p class="indent">“Yes,” said I. “But the chief danger of all
that class of reading is its   <em>easiness</em>, and the indolent,
careless mental habit it induces. A great
deal of the reading of young people on all days
is really reading to no purpose, its object being
merely present amusement. It is a listless yielding
of the mind to be washed over by a stream
which leaves no fertilizing properties, and carries
away by constant wear the good soil of thought.
I should try to establish a barrier against this
kind of reading, not only on Sunday, but on
Monday, on Tuesday, and on all days. Instead,
therefore, of objecting to any particular class of
books for Sunday reading, I should say in general
that reading merely for pastime, without any
moral aim, is the thing to be guarded against.
That which inspires no thought, no purpose,
which steals away all our strength and energy,
and makes the Sabbath a day of dreams, is the
reading I would object to.”</p>

higher spiritual nature, whether it be printed in
a church service-book or on secular sheets. On
me, for example, Beethoven’s Sonatas have a far
more deeply religious influence than much that
has religious names and words. Music is to be

<p>As the mind, looking on the great volume

it which sympathizes with itself,—as the fierce
and savage soul delights in the roar of torrents,

<div class="sidenote">Prophecy

<p>It is remarkable that in all ages, communities
and individuals who have suffered
under oppression have always fled
for refuge to the Old Testament and to the book
of Revelation in the New. Even if not definitely
understood, these magnificent compositions
have a wild, inspiring power, like a wordless, yet
impassioned symphony, played by a sublime
orchestra, in which deep and awful sub-bass instruments
mingle with those of ethereal softness,
and wild minors twine and interlace with marches
of battles and bursts of victorious harmony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span></p>

<p class="indent">They are much mistaken who say that nothing
is efficient as a motive that is not definitely understood.
Who ever thought of understanding the
mingled wail and roar of the Marseillaise? Just
this kind of indefinite stimulating power has the
Bible to the souls of the oppressed. There is
also a disposition, which has manifested itself
since the primitive times, by which the human
soul, bowed down beneath the weight of mighty
oppressions, and despairing in its own weakness,
seizes with avidity the intimations of a coming
judgment, in which the Son of Man, appearing
in His glory, and all His holy angels with Him,
shall right earth’s mighty wrongs.</p>

<p>Certainly no emotions so rigidly reject

A man unimpressible and incapable of moods and
tenses is for that reason an incompetent critic;

<div class="sidenote">Rembrandt

<p>I always did admire the gorgeous and
solemn mysteries of his coloring. Rembrandt
is like Hawthorne. He chooses
simple and every-day objects, and so arranges
light and shadow as to give them a sombre richness
and mysterious gloom. “The House of
the Seven Gables” is a succession of Rembrandt
pictures, done in words instead of oils. Now,
this pleases us, because our life really is a
haunted one, the simplest thing in it   <em>is</em> a mystery,
the invisible world always lies around us like a
shadow, and therefore this dreamy, golden gleam
of Rembrandt meets somewhat in our inner consciousness
to which it corresponds....</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rubens and
Shakespeare.</div>

<p>I should compare Rubens to Shakespeare,
for the wonderful variety and
vital force of his artistic power. I
know no other mind he so nearly resembles.
Like Shakespeare, he forces you to accept and
to forgive a thousand excesses, and uses his own
faults as musicians use discords, only to enhance
the perfection of harmony. There certainly is
some use, even in defects. A faultless style sends
you to sleep. Defects rouse and excite the sensibility
to seek and appreciate excellence. Some
of Shakespeare’s finest passages explode all
grammar and rhetoric like sky-rockets—the
thought blows the language to shivers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The effect

<p>As to Christianity not making men happier,
methinks M. Belloc forgets that
the old Greek tragedies are filled with
despair and gloom, as their prevailing characteristic,
and that nearly all the music of the world
before Christ was in the minor scale, as since
Christ it has come to be in the major. The
whole creation has, indeed, groaned and travailed
in pain together until now, but the mighty anthem
has modulated since the Cross, and the
requiem of Jesus has been the world’s birth-song
of approaching jubilee.</p>

<p class="indent">Music is a far better test, moreover, on such
a point, than painting, for just where painting is
weakest, namely, in the expression of the highest
moral and spiritual ideas, there music is most
sublimely strong.</p>

<p>To me, all music is sacred. Is it not

not be meant; yet, when we know God, so we

music. If there were pathos and power and solemn
splendor in the rhythmic movement of the
churchly chants, there was a grand, wild freedom
and energy of motion in the old “fuguing tunes”
of that day that well expressed the heart of a
people courageous in combat and unshaken in
endurance. The church chant is like the measured
motion of the mighty sea in calm weather,
but those old fuguing tunes were like that same
ocean aroused by stormy winds, when deep calleth
unto deep in tempestuous confusion, out of
which, at last, is evolved union and harmony. It
was a music suggestive of the strife, the commotion,
the battle-cries of a transition period of
society, struggling onward toward dimly seen
ideals of peace and order.</p>

<h3>THE MINISTER’S WOOING.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Earnestness
of the
New England
people.</div>

<p>It is impossible to write a story of New
England life and manners for a thoughtless,
shallow-minded person. If we
represent things as they are, their intensity,
their depth, their unworldly gravity and
earnestness must inevitably repel lighter spirits,
as the reverse pole of the magnet drives off sticks
and straws. In no other country were the soul
and the spiritual life ever such intense realities,
and everything contemplated so much (to use a
current New England phrase) “in reference to
eternity.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">New England
theology.</div>

<p>The rigid theological discipline of New
England is fitted to produce rather
strength and purity than enjoyment. It
was not fitted to make a sensitive and thoughtful
nature happy, however it might ennoble and
exalt.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The kitchen.</div>

<p>The kitchen of a New England matron
was her throne-room, her pride; it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the habit of her life to produce the greatest possible
results there with the slightest possible discomposure;
and what any woman could do, Mrs.
Katy Scudder could do <i lang="la">par excellence</i>. Everything
there seemed to be always done and never
doing. Washing and baking, those formidable
disturbers of the composure of families, were all
over within those two or three morning hours
when we are composing ourselves for a last nap,—and
only the fluttering of linen over the green
yard on Monday mornings proclaimed that the
dreaded solemnity of a wash had transpired. A
breakfast arose there as by magic; and in an
incredibly short space after, every knife, fork,
spoon, and trencher, clean and shining, was looking
as innocent and unconscious in its place as
if it never had been used and never expected
to be.</p>

<p class="indent">The floor,—perhaps, sir, you remember your
grandmother’s floor of snowy boards sanded with
whitest sand; you remember the ancient fireplace
stretching quite across one end,—a vast
cavern, in each corner of which a cozy seat
might be found, distant enough to enjoy the
crackle of the great jolly wood fire; across the
room ran a dresser, on which was displayed
great store of shining pewter dishes and platters,
which always shone with the same mysterious
brightness; by the side of the fire, a commodious
wooden settee, or “settle,” offered repose to
people too little accustomed to luxury to ask for
a cushion. Oh, that kitchen of the olden time,—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
old, clean, roomy, New England kitchen!
Who that has breakfasted, dined, and supped in
one, has not cheery visions of its thrift, its warmth,
its coolness? The noonmark on its floor was
a dial that told off some of the happiest days;
thereby did we right up some of the shortcomings
of the solemn old clock that tick-tacked in
the corner, and whose ticks seemed mysterious
prophecies of unknown good yet to arise out of
the hours of life. How dreamy the winter twilight
came in there,—when as yet the candles
were not lighted,—when the crickets chirped
around the dark stone hearth, and shifting tongues
of flame flickered and cast dancing shadows and
elfish lights on the walls, while grandmother nodded
over her knitting-work, and puss purred, and
old Rover lay dreamily opening now one eye and
then the other on the family group! With all
our ceiled houses, let us not forget our grandmother’s
kitchen.</p>

<p>She was one of the much admired class,
who, in the speech of New England, are said
to have faculty, a gift which, among that shrewd

riches, learning, or any other worldly endowment.
  <em>Faculty</em> is Yankee for  <i lang="fr">savoir faire</i>, and
the opposite virtue to shiftlessness. Faculty is
the greatest virtue, and shiftlessness the greatest
vice, of Yankee men and women. To her
who has faculty nothing shall be impossible. She
shall scrub floors, wash, wring, bake, brew, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
yet her hands shall be small and white; she
shall have no perceptible income, yet always be
handsomely dressed; she shall have not a servant
in her house,—with a dairy to manage,
hired men to feed, a boarder or two to care for,
unheard-of pickling and preserving to do,—and
yet you commonly see her every afternoon sitting
at her shady parlor-window behind the lilacs,
cool and easy, hemming muslin cap-strings, or
reading the last new book. She who hath faculty
is never in a hurry, never behindhand. She
can always step over to distressed Mrs. Smith,
whose jelly won’t come,—and stop to show
Mrs. Jones how she makes her pickles so green,—and
be ready to watch with poor old Mrs.
Simpkins, who is down with the rheumatism.</p>

Who has not loved a garret in the twilight

of quaint, cast-off, suggestive antiquity,—old,
worm-eaten chests,—rickety chairs,—boxes and
casks full of odd comminglings, out of which,
with tiny, childish hands, we picked wonderful
hoards of fairy treasure? What peep-holes,
and hiding-places, and undiscoverable retreats
we made to ourselves,—where we sat rejoicing
in our security, and bidding defiance to
the vague, distant cry which summoned us to
school, or to some unsavory every-day task!
How deliciously the rain came pattering on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
roof over our head, or the red twilight streamed
in at the window, while we sat snugly ensconced
over the delicious pages of some romance which
careful aunts had packed away at the bottom of
all things, to be sure we should never read it!
If you have anything, beloved friends, which you
wish your Charley or your Susy to be sure and
read, pack it mysteriously away at the bottom
of a trunk of stimulating rubbish in the darkest
corner of your garret; in that case, if the book
be at all readable,—one that by any possible
chance can make its way into a young mind, you
may be sure that it will not only be read, but
remembered to the longest day they have to live.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New England
the

<p>New England has been to the United
States what the Dorian hive was to
Greece. It has always been a capital
country to emigrate from, and North, South,
East, and West have been populated largely from
New England, so that the seed-bed of New England
was the seed-bed of the great American

sharpness. It is an emblem of a kind of nature
very frequent in New England, where the best

enveloped in an outside wrapping of sharp
austerity.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The do-nothing.</div>

<p>Every New England village, if you
only think of it, must have its do-nothing,
as regularly as it has its schoolhouse or its
meeting-house. Nature is always wide awake in
the matter of compensation. Work, thrift, and
industry are such an incessant steam-power in
Yankee life that society would burn itself out
with the intense friction, were there not interposed
here and there the lubricating power of
a decided do-nothing,—a man who won’t be
hurried, and won’t work, and will take his ease
in his own way, in spite of the whole protest of
his neighborhood to the contrary. And there is
on the face of the whole earth no do-nothing
whose softness, idleness, general inaptitude to
labor, and everlasting, universal shiftlessness,
can compare with that of the worthy, as found
in a brisk Yankee village.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Life an
engrossing
interest.</div>

<p>People have often supposed, because the
Puritans founded a society where there
were no professed public amusements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
that therefore there was no fun going on in the
ancient land of Israel, and that there were no
cakes and ale, because they were virtuous. They
were never more mistaken in their lives. There
was an abundance of sober, well-considered merriment,
and the hinges of life were well-oiled
with that sort of secret humor which to this day
gives the raciness to real Yankee wit. Besides
this, we must remember that life itself is the
greatest possible amusement to people who really
believe they can do much with it,—who have
that intense sense of what can be brought to pass
by human effort that was characteristic of the
New England colonies. To such, it is not exactly
proper to say that life is an amusement, but it
certainly is an engrossing interest, that takes the
place of all amusements.</p>

<p class="indent">Our minister, as I remember him, was one of
the cleanest, most gentlemanly, most well-bred of
men,—never appearing without all the decorums

well-brushed shoes, immaculately powdered wig,
out of which shone his clear, calm, serious face,

<div class="sidenote">A ship-building
community.</div>

<p>In the plain, simple regions we are
describing,—where the sea is the great
avenue of active life, and the pine forests
are the great source of wealth,—ship-building
is an engrossing interest, and there is no fête
that calls forth the community like the launching
of a vessel.</p>

<p class="indent">And no wonder; for what is there belonging
to this workaday world of ours that has such
a never-failing fund of poetry and grace as a
ship? A ship is a beauty and mystery wherever
we see it: its white wings touch the region of
the unknown and the imaginative; they seem to
us full of the odors of quaint, strange, foreign
shores, where life, we fondly dream, moves in
brighter currents than the muddy, tranquil tides
of every day.</p>

<p class="indent">Who that sees one bound outward, with her
white breasts swelling and heaving, as if with
a reaching expectancy, does not feel his heart
swell with a longing impulse to go with her to
the far-off shores? Even at dingy, crowded
wharves, amid the stir and tumult of great cities,
the coming in of a ship is an event that can
never lose its interest. But on these romantic
shores of Maine, where all is so wild and still,
and the blue sea lies embraced in the arms of a
dark, solitary forest, the sudden incoming of a
ship from a distant voyage is a sort of romance....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
The very life and spirit of strange, romantic
lands come with her; suggestions of sandalwood
and spice breathe through the pine woods;
she is an Oriental queen, with hands full of mystical
gifts; “all her garments smell of myrrh
and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they
have made her glad.” No wonder men have
loved ships like birds, and that there have been
found brave, rough hearts that in fatal wrecks
chose rather to go down with their ocean love
than to leave her in the last throes of her death-agony.</p>

<p class="indent">A ship-building, a ship-sailing community has
an unconscious poetry ever underlying its existence.
Exotic ideas from foreign lands relieve
the trite monotony of life; the ship-owner lives
in communion with the whole world, and is less
likely to fall into the petty commonplaces that
infest the routine of inland life.</p>

that chased each other up on the shelly
beach, or broke against projecting rocks, seemed
to do it with a chastened decorum, as each blue-haired
wave whispered to his brother, “Be still—be
still.”...</p>

<p class="indent">Not merely as a burdensome restraint, or a
weary endurance came the shadow of that Puritan
Sabbath. It brought with it all the sweetness
that belongs to rest, all the sacredness that
hallows home, all the memories of patient thrift,
of sober order, of chastened yet intense family
feeling, of calmness, of purity, and self-respecting
dignity, which distinguished the Puritan
household. It seemed a solemn pause in all the
sights and sounds of earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early New
England
society.</div>

<p>The state of society in some of the districts
of Maine, in these days, much
resembled, in its spirit, that which
Moses labored to produce in ruder ages. It was
entirely democratic, simple, grave, hearty, and
sincere,—solemn and religious in its daily tone,
and yet, as to all material good, full of wholesome
thrift and prosperity. Perhaps taking the
average mass of the people, a more healthful and
desirable state of society never existed. Its better
specimens had a simple, Doric grandeur,
unsurpassed in any age.</p>

<h3 class="p3">THE MAYFLOWER.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">A typical
New England
village.</div>

<p>Did you ever see the little village of
Newbury, in New England? I dare
say you never did; for it was just one
of those out-of-the-way places where nobody ever
came unless they came on purpose: a green little
hollow, wedged like a bird’s nest between half a
dozen high hills, that kept off the wind and kept
out foreigners; so that the little place was as
straitly <i lang="la">sui generis</i> as if there were not another
in the world. The inhabitants were all of that
respectable old steadfast family who made it a
point to be born, bred, married, die, and be buried,
all in the self-same spot. There were just so
many houses, and just so many people lived in
them; nobody ever seemed to be sick, or to
die either, at least while I was there. The natives
grew old till they could not grow any older,
and then they stood still, and   <em>lasted</em>, from generation
to generation. There was, too, an unchangeability
about all the externals of Newbury. Here
was a red house, and there a brown house, and
across the way was a yellow house; and there
was a straggling rail fence or a tribe of mullein
stalks between. The minister lived here, and
Squire Moses lived there, and Deacon Hart lived
under the hill, and Messrs. Nadab and Abihu
Peters lived by the cross-road, and the old “Widder
Smith” lived by the meeting-house, and
Ebenezer Camp kept a shoemaker’s shop on one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
side, and Patience Mosely kept a milliner’s shop
in front; and there was old Comfort Scran, who
kept store for the whole town, and sold axe-heads,
brass thimbles, licorice ball, fancy handkerchiefs,
and everything else you can think of. Here, too,
was the general post-office, where you might see
letters marvelously folded, directed wrong side
upwards, stamped with a thimble, and superscribed
to some of the Dollys, or Pollys, or
Peters, or Moseses aforenamed or not named.</p>

<p class="indent">For the rest, as to manners, morals, arts, and
sciences, the people in Newbury always went to
their parties at three o’clock in the afternoon,
and came home before dark; always stopped all
work the minute the sun was down on Saturday
night; always went to meeting on Sunday; had
a schoolhouse with all the ordinary inconveniences;
were in neighborly charity with one another,
read their Bibles, feared their God, and
were content with such things as they had,—the
best philosophy after all.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The farmhouse.</div>

<p>Everything in Uncle Abel’s house was
in the same time, place, manner, and
form, from year’s end to year’s end. There was
old Master Bose, a dog after my uncle’s own
heart, who always walked as if he were studying
the multiplication table. There was the old
clock, forever ticking in the kitchen corner, with
a picture on its face of the sun forever setting
behind a perpendicular row of poplar-trees.
There was the never-failing supply of red peppers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
and onions hanging over the chimney.
There, too, were the yearly hollyhocks and
morning-glories blooming about the windows.
There was the “best room,” with its sanded
floor, the cupboard in one corner with its glass
doors, the evergreen asparagus bushes in the
chimney, and there was the stand with the Bible
and almanac on it in another corner. There, too,
was Aunt Betsey, who never looked any older,
because she always looked as old as she could;
who always dried her catnip and wormwood the
last of September, and began to clean house the
first of May. In short, this was the land of continuance.
Old Time never took it into his head
to practice either addition, or subtraction, or multiplication
on its sum total.</p>

and make money out of it; and if they freeze
up all winter, they sell the ice, and make money
out of that. They just live by selling their disadvantages!”</p>


<h3 class="p3">POGANUC PEOPLE.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Yankee
grit.</div>

<p>Zeph was a creature born to oppose, as
much as white bears are made to walk
on ice.</p>

<p>And how, we ask, would New England’s rocky
soil and icy hills have been made mines of wealth
unless there had been human beings born to
oppose, delighting to combat and wrestle, and
with an unconquerable power of will?</p>

<p class="indent">Zeph had taken a thirteen acre lot, so rocky
that a sheep could scarce find a nibble there,
had dug out and blasted and carted the rocks,
wrought them into a circumambient fence,—ploughed
and planted and raised crop after crop
of good rye thereon. He did it with heat, with
zeal, with dogged determination; he did it all
the more because neighbors said he was a fool
for trying, and that he could never raise anything
on that lot. There was a stern joy in
this hand-to-hand fight with Nature. He got his
bread as Samson did his honeycomb out of the
carcass of the slain lion. “Out of the eater
came forth meat, and out of the strong came
forth sweetness.” Even the sharp March wind
did not annoy him. It was a controversial wind,
and that suited him; it was fighting him all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
way, and he enjoyed beating it. Such a human
being has his place in the Creator’s scheme.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Religious
development.</div>

<p>They greatly mistake the New England
religious development who suppose that
it was a mere culture of the head in
dry, metaphysical doctrines. As in the rifts of
the granite rocks grow flowers of wonderful
beauty and delicacy, so in the secret recesses of
Puritan life, by the fireside of the farmhouse, in
the contemplative silence of austere care and
labor, grew up religious experiences that brought
a heavenly brightness down into the poverty of
commonplace existence.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Family
worship.</div>

<p>The custom of family worship was one
of the most rigid inculcations of the
Puritan order of society, and came down from
parent to child with the big family Bible, where
the births, deaths, and marriages of the household
stood recorded.</p>

<p class="indent">In Zeph’s case, the custom seemed to be
merely an inherited tradition, which had dwindled
into a habit purely mechanical. Yet, who
shall say?</p>

<p class="indent">Of a rugged race, educated in hardness, wringing
his substance out of the very teeth and claws
of reluctant nature, on a rocky and barren soil,
and under a harsh, forbidding sky, who but the
All-seeing could judge him? In that hard soul,
there may have been, thus uncouthly expressed,
a loyalty to Something Higher, however dimly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
perceived. It was acknowledging that even he
had his master. One thing is certain, the custom
of family prayers, such as it was, was a
great comfort to the meek saint by his side, to
whom any form of prayer, any pause from earthly
care, and looking up to a Heavenly Power, was
a blessed rest. In that daily toil, often beyond
her strength, when she never received a word of
sympathy or praise, it was a comfort all day to
her to have had a chapter in the Bible and a
prayer in the morning. Even though the chapter
were one that she could not by any possibility understand
a word of, yet it put her in mind of things
in that same dear book that she did understand,—things
that gave her strength to live and hope
to die by,—and it was enough! Her faith in
the Invisible Friend was so strong that she needed
but to touch the hem of His garment. Even a
table of genealogies out of   <em>His</em> book was a sacred
charm, an amulet of peace.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The kitchen
fireplace.</div>

<p>The fire that illuminated the great
kitchen of the farmhouse was a splendid
sight to behold. It is, alas, with
us, only a vision and memory of the past; for
who, in our days, can afford to keep up the
great fireplace, where the backlogs were cut
from the giants of the forest, and the forestick
was as much as a modern man could lift? And
then the glowing fire-palace built thereon! That
architectural pile of split and seasoned wood,
over which the flames leaped and danced and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
crackled like rejoicing genii—what a glory it
was! The hearty, bright, warm hearth, in those
days, stood instead of fine furniture and handsome
pictures. The plainest room becomes beautiful
and attractive by firelight, and when men
think of a country and home to be fought for and
defended, they think of the fireside.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The curfew.</div>

<p>Though not exactly backed by the arbitrary
power which enforced the celebrated
curfew, yet the nine o’clock bell was one
of the authoritative institutions of New England;
and, at its sound, all obediently set their faces
homeward, to rake up housefires, put out candles,
and say their prayers before going to rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sincerity
and courtesy.</div>

<p>Truth before all things; sincerity before
all things; pure, clean, diamond-bright
sincerity is of more value than the gold
of Ophir; the foundation of all love must rest
here. How those people do who live in the
nearest and dearest intimacy with friends who,
they believe, will lie to them for any purpose,
even the most refined and delicate, is a mystery
to me. If I once know that my wife or my
friend will tell me only what they think will be
agreeable to me, then I am at once lost, my way
is a pathless quicksand. But all this being premised,
I still say that we Anglo-Saxons might
improve our domestic life, if we would graft
upon the strong stock of its homely sincerity the
courteous grace of the French character.</p>

no wealth of mirrors, no elegance of lounges, can
in the least make up for their absence. They

they will   <em>not</em> stay, and rooms where they   <em>will</em>,
but no one can ever have a good time without
them.</p>

keen edge of the shrewdness.</p>

in them, and bursting out in most unexpected
little jets of poetry and sentiment, like blossoms

<p>Houses have their physiognomy as much
as persons. There are commonplace
houses, suggestive houses, attractive
houses, mysterious houses, and fascinating houses,
just as there are all these classes of persons.
There are houses whose windows seem to yawn
idly—to stare vacantly; there are houses whose
windows glower weirdly, and glance at you
askance; there are houses, again, whose very
doors and windows seem wide open with frank
cordiality, which seem to stretch their arms to
embrace you, and woo you kindly to come and
possess them....</p>

<p class="indent">Is not this a species of high art, by which a
house, in itself cold and barren, becomes in every
part warm and inviting, glowing with suggestion,
alive with human tastes and personalities? Wall-paper,
paint, furniture, pictures, in the hands of
the home artist, are like the tubes of paint, out
of which arises, as by inspiration, a picture. It
is the   <em>woman</em> who combines them into the wonderful
creation which we call a home.</p>

I dare say the saints are burning with

don’t think they “sit on every heavenly hill,”
paying compliments to each other, but they are
flying hither and thither on messages of mercy

<p class="indent">A book containing passages designed to add sunshine
and comfort to the afternoon of life. The selections are
from numerous writers, of widely differing schools of
literature and religion, but are rendered harmonious by
the spirit of cheerful acceptance of the peculiar blessings
which advancing years bring, and the recognition of
the fact that though some burdens and infirmities may
accompany these years, yet they are, or at least may be,
full of cheer, of pleasant memories, and of serene hope.</p>
